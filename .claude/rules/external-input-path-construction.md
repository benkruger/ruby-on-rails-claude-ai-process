# External-Input Path Construction

When a state-derived string (state-file value, env var, parsed JSON
field, hand-edited config) flows into filesystem path construction,
the value must pass a positive validator BEFORE the path is built.
Same discipline for external file reads: every read of a
caller-controlled or state-derived path must enforce a documented
size cap so a corrupted or hostile input cannot cause unbounded I/O.

This rule is a specialization of
`.claude/rules/external-input-validation.md` for the specific case
of strings reaching `format!`, `Path::join`, `PathBuf::from`, or
`fs::*::open`. The parent rule covers panicking constructors; this
rule covers the silent-corruption surface where untrusted strings
become filesystem paths or file descriptors.

## Why

Two failure modes recur whenever state-derived strings reach the
filesystem:

1. **Path traversal / arbitrary file read.** A `session_id` or
   `transcript_path` value lives in `state.json` — a file that
   any process with filesystem access can hand-edit, that
   external tools can corrupt, and that interrupted writes can
   leave malformed. Interpolating that value into
   `format!("{}.txt", session_id)` or passing it to
   `fs::File::open(path)` lets a malicious or accidental string
   redirect a read to `../../etc/passwd`,
   `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`, or any file the running user can
   read. The fail-open pattern (`.ok()?`) makes the redirect
   silent.
2. **Unbounded resource consumption.** A transcript file or
   session log can grow to hundreds of megabytes during a long
   autonomous flow. When a per-step capture re-reads the file
   at every state mutation, total I/O scales as O(producers ×
   file_size) and can OOM-kill the process mid-write,
   corrupting the state file. The module's "no panic, no
   block" promise is broken whenever the read is unbounded.

Both failure modes are silent. Production code paths return
`None` or default values when the read fails, masking the
attempted attack or the resource exhaustion. The defense must
happen BEFORE the read, in a positive validator.

## The Rule

For every state-derived or env-var-derived string that flows
into a filesystem path or file open:

1. **Validate before constructing.** Pass the value through a
   positive validator (`is_safe_<purpose>`) that rejects empty
   strings, traversal segments (`.`, `..`), path separators
   (`/`, `\`), NUL bytes, and any character outside the closed
   set the production code expects.
2. **Validate against a known-good prefix when possible.** When
   the value is a path itself (transcript path, log path,
   etc.), require it to be absolute AND rooted under a
   well-known directory (`<home>/.claude/projects/`,
   `<project_root>/.flow-states/`). Reject anything outside the
   prefix.
3. **Enforce a documented size cap on every external read.**
   `BufReader::new(file.take(BYTE_CAP))` is the canonical
   pattern. The cap lives as a module-level `const` with a doc
   comment naming the worst-case scenario it bounds. The cap
   applies whether the read is keyed off a state-derived path
   OR is part of a directory walk that reads each file the
   walker yields — both shapes can encounter generated, golden,
   or hostile files larger than the function's working memory.
4. **Document the validation contract in the function's doc
   comment.** Name the rejected character classes, the
   prefix-containment requirement, and the byte cap. Future
   sessions reading the function must see the contract without
   tracing callers.
5. **Validate env-var-derived paths as absolute.** When a
   module reads `$HOME` (or any env var) and joins it with a
   relative suffix, an unset or relative env var produces a
   cwd-relative path that resolves against the worktree root.
   In a hostile or misconfigured repo, that lets a committed
   `.claude/rate-limits.json` (or equivalent) be read as the
   user's data. Reject empty / non-absolute env-var values
   before joining.

## What Counts as State-Derived

A string is state-derived when its value comes from any of:

- A field in `.flow-states/<branch>/state.json` (or any other
  on-disk JSON the process reads at runtime)
- An environment variable (including `HOME`, `USER`, custom
  vars)
- Parsed JSON from a subprocess (`gh issue view --json ...`,
  `git log --format=%H ...`)
- A user-supplied CLI flag (`--branch`, `--issue`)
- A hand-editable config file (`.flow.json`, `.claude/settings.json`)

State-derived is NOT:

- A compile-time constant (`const FOO: &str = "..."`)
- A value derived from a guaranteed-valid source already
  validated upstream (e.g., a branch name produced by
  `branch_name()` at flow-start, then read back from state in
  the same process)

When in doubt, treat as state-derived and validate.

## Reference Implementation

`src/window_snapshot.rs` is the canonical example:

- `is_safe_session_id(s: &str) -> bool` — accepts only ASCII
  alphanumeric plus `-` and `_`; rejects empty, `.`, `..`, and
  any other character.
- `is_safe_transcript_path(path: &Path, home: &Path) -> bool`
  — requires absolute, NUL-free, rooted under
  `<home>/.claude/projects/`.
- `read_rate_limits(home: &Path)` — early-returns when `home`
  is empty or non-absolute, preventing cwd-relative resolution
  of `.claude/rate-limits.json`.
- `read_transcript(path: &Path)` — caps reads at
  `TRANSCRIPT_BYTE_CAP = 50 MB` via
  `BufReader::new(file.take(TRANSCRIPT_BYTE_CAP))`. The
  constant carries a doc comment naming the long-autonomous-flow
  scenario it bounds.

## Plan-Phase Trigger

When a plan task proposes a new function that reads files from
the filesystem — whether the read is keyed off a state-derived
string OR is part of a recursive walk that reads each file the
walker yields — the plan's Risks section must enumerate:

1. **Source.** Where does the string enter the process, OR
   what subtree does the walker traverse? (state field, env
   var, JSON parse, CLI flag, OR walk root + descent rules.)
2. **Sink.** What construction does the string flow into, OR
   what file-open call does the walker make per entry?
   (`format!`, `Path::join`, `PathBuf::from`, `fs::File::open`,
   `fs::read_to_string`, etc.)
3. **Validator.** Which `is_safe_<purpose>` function (or
   equivalent positive validator) gates the construction? For
   walks, name the per-entry filter (extension check, name
   filter, file-type check) that limits which files are read.
4. **Cap.** For every file read, the byte cap that bounds I/O.
   This applies to direct `read_to_string` calls AND to walks
   that read each yielded file. A plan that lists "walk
   `tests/` for `.rs` files and read each one" without a
   `BYTE_CAP` constant is incomplete.

A plan that proposes a new external-input read OR a new
filesystem walk without naming all four is incomplete.

## How to Apply

**Code phase.** When implementing a function that reads a
state-derived string and uses it in path construction:

1. Write the validator helper FIRST — its doc comment names
   the rejection classes and the prefix-containment
   requirement.
2. Call the validator at the boundary where the untrusted value
   enters the function — typically a public parameter or a JSON
   field extraction. `.filter(is_safe_*)` on `Option<&str>`
   extracted from JSON is the canonical pattern.
3. For file reads, declare the byte cap as a module-level
   `const` with a doc comment, then wrap the reader in
   `BufReader::new(file.take(THAT_CAP))`.
4. For filesystem walks, apply the cap to every per-entry
   read, not only to a single state-derived read.
5. Test every rejection class — empty, `.`, `..`, traversal,
   NUL byte, prefix-escape, oversized read. The tests live
   alongside the validator, not at the consumer.

**Review phase.** The reviewer agent and adversarial
agent check every new state-derived path-construction site
AND every new filesystem walk for the validator and the byte
cap. Findings tagged "path traversal via X", "arbitrary file
read via Y", or "unbounded read in walk Z" are Real findings
that get fixed in the same PR per
`.claude/rules/review-scope.md`.

## No `.expect()` on Filesystem Reads in Hooks or CLI Subcommands

Hook scripts (`src/hooks/*.rs`) and CLI subcommands
(`src/*.rs::run_impl`) run under user-visible session lifecycle.
A `.expect()` on `fs::read_dir`, `fs::symlink_metadata`,
`fs::File::open`, or `fs::read_to_string` produces a Rust panic
and backtrace at the user's terminal — the same blast radius as
a panicking constructor invariant. Per
`.claude/rules/external-input-validation.md` "Hook callsite
discipline," hooks must never construct branch-scoped state via
`FlowPaths::new`; the same discipline applies to filesystem
operations: hooks and CLI subcommands must use `match`, `?`, or
`.ok()` chained to a non-panicking fallback (early return, skip
the entry, swallow to `continue`).

The `.expect("...")` carve-out from
`.claude/rules/testability-means-simplicity.md` "When the test
resists the real production path" remains valid for unreachable
arms — but the exception must be paired with proof that the arm
is genuinely unreachable from any production path. A `.expect()`
on `fs::read_dir(<repo_subtree>)` is reachable when the subtree
is unreadable (chmod 0, transient I/O failure, race with
concurrent removal); the test is what proves reachability or
the absence of it. Filesystem walks must swallow every error to
`continue` rather than panic, with `.expect` reserved only for
genuinely TOCTOU-only branches whose unreachability is provable
(e.g., `symlink_metadata` succeeding on a freshly-iterated
`read_dir` entry).
