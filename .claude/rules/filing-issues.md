# Filing Issues

## Brainstorming Is Not Filing

When the user says "lets brainstorm", "lets think about", or "what
if we" — they want a discussion, not a workflow. Do not invoke
`flow:flow-create-issue`, `decompose:decompose`, or any filing
skill. Discuss the idea interactively. Only invoke filing skills
when the user explicitly says "file an issue" or "create an issue."

## Default to Inclusion

When drafting an issue body or scoping a Plan-phase task list,
default to including adjacent concerns rather than excluding
them. The question is not "should this be in scope?" but "is
there a *concrete* reason this must NOT be in scope?" See
`.claude/rules/include-bias-in-issues.md` for the principle, the
bad-reasoning patterns to avoid (prior-PR boundaries, code
ownership, separate code surface, would-expand-scope), and the
narrow valid exclusions. The lifecycle cost of splitting a
concern out of an issue is multiples larger than including it
in the current flow's exploration budget.

## After Decompose Output

When filing issues that originated from a `/decompose:decompose`
analysis in the current conversation, always use
`/flow:flow-create-issue` — never bare `bin/flow issue`. The
decompose output IS the pre-planning. Filing without it discards
the exploration, risks, approach, and task breakdown that the
decompose produced.

The signal: if the conversation contains a DAG synthesis with
codebase exploration, file references, and an approach — the
issues are pre-planned by definition.

## The Pattern

`bin/flow issue --body-file <path>` resolves `<path>` against
`project_root()` (the main repo root), but the `validate-worktree-paths`
hook blocks writing files directly to the main repo when the session
is running inside a linked worktree. Using a relative path like
`.flow-issue-body` creates a split: the Write tool writes it to the
worktree (where the hook allows writes), but `bin/flow issue` then
looks for it at `<main_repo>/.flow-issue-body` (where it does not
exist). The fix is to always pass an absolute worktree path.

1. Write the issue body to `<worktree>/.flow-issue-body` (or
   `<worktree>/.flow-issue-body-1`, etc., for parallel filing)
   using the Write tool — the worktree path is allowed by the
   `validate-worktree-paths` hook
2. Call `bin/flow issue --title "..." --body-file
   <worktree>/.flow-issue-body` using the absolute worktree path
3. The script reads the file, deletes it, then creates the issue

When not in a worktree (no active FLOW phase), the project root
IS the repo root — a relative path `.flow-issue-body` works because
the Write tool and `bin/flow issue` both resolve to the same
directory. Use the relative form in that case.

## Editing Existing Issues

Use the same `.flow-issue-body` temp file pattern with the same
absolute-worktree-path discipline described above:

1. Write the updated body to `<worktree>/.flow-issue-body` using the Write tool
2. Call `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body-file
   <worktree>/.flow-issue-body`
3. Delete `<worktree>/.flow-issue-body` yourself — `gh issue edit`
   does not auto-delete

Never write temp files to `/tmp/` — the project's `defaultMode:
"plan"` has no allow-list pattern for `/tmp/` paths, triggering
permission prompts.

## Rules

- Never pass body text as a command line argument — special
  characters trigger the Bash hook validator
- Never delete `.flow-issue-body` yourself when creating — the
  script handles cleanup after reading
- Always use `bin/flow issue` for creating — never call
  `gh issue create` directly

## Content Standards

Issues are bug reports, not design documents. Capture
the problem with zero solutioning. Research, diagnosis,
and design happen in the Plan phase after proper codebase
exploration.

**Exception: Decomposed issues.** Issues filed by
`flow-create-issue` include an Implementation Plan section
(Context, Exploration, Risks, Approach, Dependency Graph,
Tasks). This is the only context where solution design
belongs in an issue body — these issues are pre-planned
for fast-tracking through the Plan phase.

- **Write for a cold start.** A future session has no
  memory of this conversation. The issue is its only
  context for the problem.
- **Describe what is broken and why it matters.** Include
  observable behavior, evidence (state file values, error
  messages, logs), and user impact.
- **Include reproduction steps.** Steps or conditions that
  trigger the problem.
- **Name files to investigate, not files to change.** Point
  to where the behavior originates so the Plan phase knows
  where to start reading.
- **File independent issues in parallel.** Use different
  temp file names (e.g., `.flow-issue-body-1`,
  `.flow-issue-body-2`) and launch all Write + `bin/flow
  issue` calls concurrently.

## Verify Before Filing

When filing a bug discovered during a FLOW phase (Review
tech debt, Learn process gaps), read the relevant source code
and verify the root cause before filing. A hypothesis about
what might be happening is not evidence. The issue body must
contain the verified mechanism — file path, line number, and
what the code actually does — not a guess about what it might
do. A cold-start session should be able to act on the issue
without re-doing the investigation.

## Value Test Before Filing

Before filing any issue derived from a FLOW phase finding,
apply the same value test that
`.claude/rules/review-scope.md` applies to Review
findings — adapted for the issue-filing decision:

> **Was the gap caught by another phase gate AND remediated in
> this PR (code fix, rule clarification, or new rule)?**
>
> - If yes → the system already closed the gap. Record it in
>   the commit message and the Learn report. Do not file an
>   issue.
> - If no → the gap is open. File it.

The trap to avoid: framing "Plan phase didn't catch X but Code
Review did" as a process gap. Review IS part of the
process. The cognitive-isolation design (four sub-agents)
exists precisely to catch what the Plan author missed. A
Review-caught-and-fixed violation is the system working,
not a gap.

A real Tenant 1 process gap looks like one of:

- A class of bug where no phase gate would have caught it —
  the bug shipped, was discovered post-merge, and nothing in
  the existing process would have prevented it.
- A workflow step that broke (skill error, hook misfire, state
  corruption) and the error path was undefined or destructive.
- An async/dangling operation: a background agent that never
  reported back, a state mutation without a paired commit, a
  notification that never fired.

### Friction Is Not a Process Gap

A scanner that fires correctly, an opt-out the author had to
type, a repair round that resolved the violation — these are
the gate doing its job. They are NOT process gaps, even when
the friction feels excessive in a single flow. Specifically,
none of the following count as Tenant 1 findings:

- "The scanner over-fired and I had to add N opt-out comments."
- "A contract test rejected my change twice before it cleared."
- "The rule required me to enumerate X items in a table."
- "I had to write a manual workaround the rule documents."

These are the cost of the rule the project chose to enforce.
The rule already has an opt-out grammar OR a documented
workaround OR a published cost; using it is not a gap.

A friction report becomes filable only when ALL three hold:

1. **Recurrence across flows.** The same friction has been
   observed in three or more separate flows by Learn-phase
   findings, not anticipated as one-off in the current flow.
2. **Cost is disproportionate.** The opt-out count, repair
   rounds, or workaround steps exceed what the rule's design
   intended (read the rule file's "How to Apply" or "Trigger"
   section — if the friction is what the rule names as the
   cost, it is intended).
3. **A concrete cheaper enforcement exists.** The filer can
   name a specific scanner refinement, opt-out grammar
   extension, or rule-vocabulary change that would reduce
   friction without losing the gate's protective intent.

If any of (1)–(3) is missing, do not file. Single-flow
friction is not a signal — it is one data point, and the
project's curated-closed scanner philosophy explicitly prefers
some friction over false-positive sweeps from premature
scanner expansion.

A real Tenant 2 enforcement escalation looks like:

- A rule that was clear, applicable, and ignored AND the same
  violation has been observed across multiple flows — pattern,
  not one-off — AND instruction-level enforcement has
  demonstrably failed to fix it.

When in doubt, do not file. The cost of an un-filed real issue
is one more flow surfacing it; the cost of a filed bogus issue
is triage time on every future session that opens the issue
list.

## Repo Routing

Most issue-filing paths target the current project (omit `--repo`):
Tech Debt, Documentation Drift, and decomposed work items all
describe problems in the user's code.

FLOW process bugs — problems with the plugin itself — must target
`benkruger/flow`. Pass `--repo benkruger/flow` when filing against
the plugin repo. The Phase 4 `flow-learn` skill is the only skill
that routes process gaps cross-repo automatically:

- `flow-learn` (Phase 4) — files process gap issues with `--repo`

`flow-create-issue` is the related capture skill but it always files
to the **current** repo (no `--repo` flag) — it does not prompt for
a target. To file a FLOW process bug manually from a target project,
invoke `bin/flow issue --repo benkruger/flow` directly rather than
going through `flow-create-issue`.

When in doubt, ask the user. Filing against the wrong repo is
worse than one extra question.

## Dependencies

When filing an issue that depends on another issue, set the native
blocked-by relationship with `bin/flow link-blocked-by`:

```bash
bin/flow link-blocked-by --repo <owner/repo> \
  --blocked-number <blocked> --blocking-number <blocking>
```

`flow-issues` detects blocked status from GitHub's native
`blockedBy` relationship — no "Blocked" label is required.

## Never Include

These rules apply to standard issues. Decomposed issues filed
by `flow-create-issue` are exempt — they include an Implementation
Plan section by design.

- Root cause analysis — a guess is not analysis
- Proposed solutions or "open questions" about tradeoffs
- Prescribed code changes or architectural suggestions
- Diagnosis of why the bug happens — only what happens
