# No Waivers — 100% Coverage, No Escape Hatch

All Rust code in the FLOW repo must be covered by tests. There is no
waiver mechanism. `test_coverage.md`, `security_waivers.md`, or any
similar per-line exception file is forbidden — neither the file itself
nor the discipline that authorizes one.

## The Rule

When a code path appears unreachable from in-process tests, the
default response is one of:

1. **Add a subprocess test** that spawns the compiled binary
   (`tests/main_dispatch.rs` is the reference) and exercises the
   path through the real CLI surface. cargo-llvm-cov instruments
   subprocess calls when they invoke the same binary, so the lines
   become covered.
2. **Refactor the code** to make it testable from in-process tests.
   The reference pattern is the `run_impl_main(...) -> (Value, i32)`
   seam that returns its result instead of calling
   `process::exit` directly. Tests call the helper, assert on the
   tuple, and the thin wrapper does the print + exit.
3. **Change the design** so the path is not needed. If a function
   has a defensive branch that no production caller can reach,
   delete the branch.

If none of these work, the code is wrong — not the test surface.

## Forbidden Plan Prose

A plan is incomplete if any of its prose proposes a waiver entry,
even conditionally. The following prose patterns violate this rule:

- "Add a `test_coverage.md` entry for ..."
- "If any line remains uncoverable ..."
- "Strategy: prefer coverage over waivers" (mentions waivers as
  even a possibility)
- "Waiver candidates: ..."
- "If coverage cannot be achieved ..."
- "Record the achievable baseline"
- "Accept the current measurement as the target"
- Any conditional branch in plan prose where the unreachable case
  is "file a waiver"

A plan that includes any of these is not "going to consider waivers
as a last resort" — it is *already proposing waivers*. Such a plan
is incomplete and must be rewritten.

## Measurement-Only Task Antipattern

A plan task that defines its success criterion as "measure the current
coverage TOTAL" — instead of "confirm coverage reaches 100%" — is a
waiver dressed up as a task shape. A session that executes such a task
will record the measurement, declare victory, and move on with coverage
below 100%. That is a waiver.

This antipattern is forbidden even when the plan also contains explicit
iteration language elsewhere ("if below 100%, return to the relevant
test task"). Execution agents gravitate toward the measurement task
body, not toward the iteration clause — so the iteration clause is
effectively a waiver escape hatch.

**The rule.** A plan that includes a "verify 100%" task must hard-gate
phase completion on the 100% result. Measurement-only outputs are not
acceptable completion criteria for coverage-gated tasks. The task body
must:

1. Run `bin/flow ci` to capture the TOTAL.
2. If below 100% per-file, return to the preceding test task and add
   coverage until the target is met.
3. Only proceed when every targeted file reads 100% per the plan's
   acceptance criteria.

A task that writes "record the achievable baseline" or "accept the
current measurement as the achievable target" violates this rule.

**When authoring the plan.** When a plan's acceptance criteria state
"all N files reach 100%" but the plan's tasks only verify the
aggregate TOTAL without per-file iteration, the plan is incomplete.
The plan author must either strengthen the verification task to
hard-gate on per-file 100% or revise the acceptance criteria to
match what the tasks actually produce.

## Why

The waiver path is a slippery slope. Once a plan proposes a waiver
"only as a fallback," the Code phase will exercise the fallback
because some uncovered lines are always inconvenient to reach. The
inconvenient lines accumulate as waivers, the waiver inventory
grows, and the actual test surface shrinks. The cost of the "no
waivers, ever" rule is forcing the harder solution upfront. The
benefit is that every line is exercised and a future refactor can
trust the test suite to catch regressions across the entire surface.

## Enforcement

This rule is the project's gate against waiver drift. It is
enforced at three layers:

1. **Rule prose** (this file). The first instrument is the rule
   itself — every plan author must read this file when designing
   coverage strategy.
2. **Code Review reviewer agent**. The reviewer agent flags any
   diff that adds a `test_coverage.md` entry as a Real finding to
   be deleted in Step 4.
3. **Coverage gate in `bin/test`**. Every `bin/flow ci` full-suite
   run passes `--fail-under-lines 100 --fail-under-regions 100
   --fail-under-functions 100` to `cargo llvm-cov nextest`. Any
   uncovered region, function, or line fails CI and blocks the
   commit. The thresholds are pinned at 100 and never lowered. The
   flags live on the `cargo llvm-cov nextest` invocation inside
   `bin/test`, so every CI run by every engineer on every branch
   inherits the same gate.

## How to Apply (When Authoring the Plan)

When designing a plan that touches code:

1. Identify every code path the changes will introduce.
2. For each path, decide how it will be tested. Choose from the
   three default responses above.
3. Do not write "if X is hard to reach, add a waiver" anywhere in
   the plan. If X is hard to reach, decide which of the three
   responses fits and write THAT in the plan.
4. After writing the plan, grep for waiver-suggestion phrases. If
   any appear, rewrite them.
5. If the plan has a "verify 100%" task, confirm the task body
   hard-gates on per-file 100% (not measurement-only).

## How to Apply (Code Phase)

When implementing code that has a hard-to-reach branch:

1. Try the three default responses in order. Subprocess test first
   (cheapest), refactor second, design change third.
2. If you find yourself wanting to file a waiver, stop. The waiver
   instinct is a signal that you have not yet found the right test
   surface — it is never the answer.
3. Commit the test or refactor in the same task as the code that
   would otherwise be uncovered.

## How to Apply (Code Review Phase)

When triaging findings:

1. If a finding describes a coverage gap, the only valid fixes are
   subprocess test, refactor, or design change. "Add a waiver" is
   never a valid fix and the finding stays open until one of the
   three responses lands.
2. If the diff adds a `test_coverage.md` entry, route the entry
   for deletion in Step 4 regardless of file location. Per
   `.claude/rules/supersession.md`, the entry is dead code in the
   PR's wake.
