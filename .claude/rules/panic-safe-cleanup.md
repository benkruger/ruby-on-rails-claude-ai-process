# Panic-Safe Resource Cleanup

When code acquires a resource that REQUIRES cleanup before normal
termination — terminal raw mode, alternate-screen buffer, file
locks, network connections, lockfiles, GPU contexts, ANY mode that
must be reset for the process exit to be sane — the cleanup MUST
run via a Drop-implementing RAII guard, not via inline cleanup
calls at function exit.

## Why

Inline cleanup at scope-exit is a footgun for any resource whose
"unset" state must be restored. Rust panics unwind the stack — they
do NOT execute code after the panicking call. A panic inside the
work block skips inline cleanup, leaving the resource in its
acquired state.

The Drop impl runs on every exit path including panic unwind — that
is the only mechanism the language guarantees.

## The Rule

For every code path that does:

```rust
acquire_resource()?;
do_work();        // <-- can panic
release_resource(); // <-- skipped on panic
```

Replace the pattern with a Drop guard:

```rust
struct ResourceGuard { /* holds whatever release_resource needs */ }

impl Drop for ResourceGuard {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // best-effort release; cannot return errors
        let _ = release_resource(self);
    }
}

fn do_thing() -> Result<()> {
    acquire_resource()?;
    let _guard = ResourceGuard { /* ... */ };
    do_work()  // panic-safe; _guard drops on unwind
}
```

## What Counts as a Resource Requiring Cleanup

- **Terminal modes** — raw mode, alternate screen, mouse capture,
  bracketed paste. Reference: `TerminalGuard<F>` in `src/tui_terminal.rs`.
- **File locks** — `flock`, `fcntl` advisory locks. The lockfile
  must be released even on panic or the next process blocks
  forever.
- **Spawned child processes you intend to wait on** — orphaning
  is sometimes acceptable but only after explicit decision.
- **Mutated global state** — env vars set for the duration of an
  operation, signal handlers swapped temporarily, anything that
  the process exit will not naturally restore.
- **Open file descriptors with side effects** — fsync-pending
  writes, named pipes opened for write, sockets that need
  `shutdown()`.

NOT every resource needs a Drop guard. Allocations that release
naturally on drop (Vec, String, Box) handle themselves. The
discipline applies specifically to resources whose "released" state
is not the default.

## Reference Implementation

The canonical example is `TerminalGuard<F>` in
`src/tui_terminal.rs`. The guard is parameterized over a cleanup
closure so production passes the real crossterm restore logic
while unit tests pass a flag-setting closure that records
whether Drop ran:

```rust
pub struct TerminalGuard<F: FnMut()> {
    release_fn: Option<F>,
}

impl<F: FnMut()> TerminalGuard<F> {
    pub fn new(release_fn: F) -> Self {
        Self { release_fn: Some(release_fn) }
    }
}

impl<F: FnMut()> Drop for TerminalGuard<F> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        if let Some(mut f) = self.release_fn.take() {
            f();
        }
    }
}
```

The guard:

1. Owns the cleanup closure.
2. Implements `Drop` with errors swallowed inside the closure
   (`let _ = ...`) because Drop cannot return them and a
   panic-during-cleanup is worse than a swallowed error.
3. Uses `Option::take` so the closure runs at most once.
4. Is placed in scope BEFORE the work that might panic.
5. Is a named struct (not `defer!`-style scope_guard crate) so
   the responsibility is documented in the type system.

The closure-injection design — exposing `release_fn` as a generic
parameter rather than hardcoding the cleanup body — also makes
the Drop unit-testable without a real terminal. See
`.claude/rules/rust-patterns.md` "Seam-injection variant for
externally-coupled code".

## Plan-Phase Trigger

When a plan task acquires a resource of any of the categories
listed above, the plan must enumerate:

1. The **resource** being acquired (terminal mode, file lock, etc.)
2. The **release call** that must run on every exit path
3. The **guard struct name** that wraps the release in Drop
4. Where the guard is placed in scope (must be BEFORE the
   panic-prone work)

A plan that says "guarantee cleanup on every return path" without
naming the Drop guard is incomplete. "Cleanup before each return"
or "cleanup in a deferred block" are anti-patterns — they do not
survive panic.

## How to Apply (Code Phase)

1. Define the guard struct first. Implement Drop with error
   swallowing.
2. Place the guard in scope IMMEDIATELY after acquiring the
   resource — before any work that might panic.
3. Test the guard explicitly. The simplest test acquires the
   resource, panics, catches the panic, and verifies the resource
   is released:

   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn guard_releases_on_panic() {
       let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
           let _guard = ResourceGuard::acquire();
           panic!("simulated work failure");
       });
       assert!(result.is_err());
       assert!(resource_is_released());
   }
   ```

4. Document the guard's Drop behavior in its type doc comment —
   what gets cleaned up, what errors are swallowed, why.

## How to Apply (Review Phase)

When the reviewer agent or pre-mortem agent finds resource
acquisition in production code, verify:

1. The release path is in a Drop impl, not inline at scope-exit
2. The guard is in scope BEFORE any operation that might panic
3. There is a test that proves cleanup runs on panic unwind
