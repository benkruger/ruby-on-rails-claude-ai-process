# Security Gates

When a CLI subcommand or entry point guards an action against
caller input (phase name, outcome, file path, flag), the guard
must be robust to input variation and fail-closed on uncertainty.
A guard that silently accepts a whitespace-padded or BOM-prefixed
input is not a guard — it is a suggestion the caller can ignore
by accident.

This rule applies to every gate that reads string input from the
CLI or from a state file and decides whether to permit or reject
an action. Examples in this codebase: `review_filing_gate`
in `src/add_finding.rs`, `should_reject_for_review` in
`src/issue.rs`. Future gates should follow the same discipline.

## Normalize Before Comparing

Any string input that participates in a gate decision must be
normalized before comparison:

1. **Strip NULs** with `.replace('\0', "")`. Embedded NULs from
   truncated writes or editor artifacts defeat byte-equality.
2. **Trim whitespace** with `.trim()`. Leading or trailing
   whitespace from CLI args or state-file padding defeats
   byte-equality.
3. **Lowercase with ASCII semantics** (`to_ascii_lowercase()`)
   when the comparison is conceptually case-insensitive. Phase
   names, outcome names, and command names in FLOW are all
   intended to be case-insensitive for robustness.

Normalization runs on BOTH sides of the comparison: if you are
checking `input == "flow-review"`, either normalize
`"flow-review"` too or spell out that the right-hand side is
already normalized. Asymmetric normalization is the bug that
adversarial tests find.

Extract normalization into a named helper when multiple gates
share the same logic:

```rust
fn normalize_gate_input(s: &str) -> String {
    s.replace('\0', "").trim().to_ascii_lowercase()
}
```

## Positive Allowlist, Not Negative Denylist

When a gate enforces "only values in set X are permitted during
context Y," encode it as a positive allowlist membership check,
not as a denylist of forbidden values. A denylist fails the
moment a new value is added to the domain — the new value
silently passes the gate.

Example (correct — positive allowlist):

```rust
const REVIEW_ALLOWED_OUTCOMES: &[&str] = &["fixed", "dismissed"];
if !REVIEW_ALLOWED_OUTCOMES.contains(&outcome_norm.as_str()) {
    return reject();
}
```

Example (wrong — denylist):

```rust
if outcome_norm == "filed" {
    return reject();
}
// A future "deferred" outcome silently passes.
```

The allowlist makes the rule's invariant explicit in code: "Code
Review accepts exactly these outcomes."

## Fail Closed When State Is Unreliable

When a gate reads state from a file (e.g., `current_phase` from
`.flow-states/<branch>/state.json`), distinguish three input states:

1. **No file / empty content** → pass. The command is running
   outside an active flow. This is legitimate usage.
2. **Non-empty content that parses and contains the expected
   field** → apply the gate logic.
3. **Non-empty content that fails to parse, has the wrong root
   type, or is missing the expected field** → **fail CLOSED**.
   Return a rejection message explaining that the phase could
   not be determined. Silent fall-through to "gate passes"
   means a corrupted state file becomes an escape hatch.

Fail-closed semantics matter most when the state file signals
that a flow is active but the gate cannot tell which phase. A
kill signal, interrupted write, or hand edit that leaves the
file unparseable must not silently disable the gate.

## Gate-Action Atomicity for Validated Paths

When a gate validates an input by transforming it (resolving a
relative path against a base, normalizing `..` segments,
canonicalizing case, applying a substitution), the action that
runs after the gate must use the **transformed value**, not the
original input. A gate that approves the transformed value while
the action operates on the untransformed value is two
guarantees, not one — the action's result can diverge from what
the gate authorized.

The classic shape: a CLI gate accepts `--path <relative>`,
resolves it to an absolute path against `project_root` for
canonical comparison, and then a downstream `fs::write(args.path,
...)` writes the original `args.path` — which `fs::write`
re-resolves against the **process cwd**. From a subdirectory cwd
the two resolutions differ, the gate said yes, and the file
lands somewhere the gate would have rejected if it had seen the
final destination.

### The Rule

For every gate that transforms its input, the post-gate action
must consume the transformed value. Concretely:

1. **Capture the transformed value.** When the gate computes a
   resolved/normalized/canonicalized form of the input, bind it
   to a local variable.
2. **Pass the transformed value to the action.** Every
   downstream call (`fs::write`, `Command::new(...).arg(...)`,
   `serde_json::from_str`, `Path::join`, etc.) must take the
   transformed value as its argument, never the raw input.
3. **Don't preserve the raw input out of habit.** Storing
   `args.path` and using it for the action because "that's what
   the user typed" is exactly the bug — the user typed an
   ambiguous value that the gate had to disambiguate.

### Why

Path resolution is the canonical instance because both `fs::*`
and the FLOW gate share a `&Path` interface but resolve relative
paths against different bases (process cwd vs project_root).
The same shape recurs for any input that has multiple
representations:

- **Symlink resolution** — gate canonicalizes via
  `Path::canonicalize`, action calls a syscall on the original
  symlink which `open(2)` may resolve differently under
  concurrent rename.
- **Branch validation** — gate validates the branch via
  `FlowPaths::is_valid_branch`, action constructs a path from
  `args.branch` directly. The validated branch and the action's
  branch are the same string in this case, but if the validation
  applied case folding or NUL stripping, the action must use the
  normalized form.
- **JSON-canonical comparison** — gate compares a parsed
  representation, action serializes a separate copy. Bind the
  parsed value once and round-trip it for the action.

### Plan-phase Trigger

When a plan task introduces a gate that **transforms its input
before comparison** — resolves a relative path, normalizes
casing, canonicalizes a value — the plan's Risks section must
enumerate:

1. The **transformation** the gate applies (e.g., "join
   `--path` against `project_root` to produce
   `provided_abs`").
2. The **action** that runs after the gate (e.g.,
   `fs::write(<arg>, content)`).
3. The **path source** the action consumes — must be the
   transformed value, not the original input.
4. The **regression test** that proves divergence is detected
   (e.g., subprocess test running from a subdirectory cwd with
   a relative `--path`, asserting the file lands at the
   gate-validated destination).

A plan that introduces a transforming gate without naming all
four is incomplete.

### Code-phase Discipline

Implement the gate as a function that returns the transformed
value as part of its success result, not as a side effect on a
shared variable:

```rust
// Good — the success path returns the transformed value
// so callers physically cannot use the original input.
match canonicalize_for_gate(&args.path)? {
    GateOutcome::Accepted(provided_abs) => {
        write_rule(provided_abs.to_str().unwrap(), &content)?;
    }
    GateOutcome::Rejected(reason) => return reject(reason),
}
```

```rust
// Wrong — args.path is still in scope for the action,
// inviting the divergence.
if !canonicalize_for_gate(&args.path)? {
    return reject();
}
write_rule(&args.path, &content)?; // BUG: re-resolved against process cwd
```

### Review Discipline

The reviewer agent and the adversarial agent both audit
post-gate actions for "uses the transformed value, not the raw
input." A finding tagged "gate-action divergence" or "gate
validates X but action consumes Y" is a Real finding fixed in
Step 4 per `.claude/rules/review-scope.md`.

## Enumerate Bypass Variants Before Coding, Not After

When a plan task adds a string-input gate, the test task that
precedes it must enumerate bypass variants explicitly in the
plan's Risks or test-notes section. The adversarial agent will
find these variants during Review if the tests do not cover
them — which wastes a Review cycle on work the Plan phase
could have prevented.

Minimum variant checklist for every string-input gate:

1. **Whitespace** — leading, trailing, and interior whitespace
2. **Case** — UPPERCASE, MixedCase, lowercase (at least two
   variants if comparison is intended to be case-insensitive)
3. **Embedded NUL** — trailing `\0` and interior `\0`
4. **Type variants** (for state-file gates) — current_phase
   as number, boolean, null, array, missing key
5. **Encoding** (for state-file gates) — UTF-8 BOM prefix,
   duplicate keys (serde last-wins)
6. **Boundary** — empty string, single-character strings
7. **Override** (if applicable) — flag set, flag unset, flag with
   explicit `=false` or `=true` forms

For each variant, add a test case. The unit tests for the pure
gate helper cover most of these; the integration test (binary
spawn with prepared state) covers the ones that depend on
subprocess state.

The discipline: write the variant list FIRST, then write the
tests from the list, then write the implementation.

## How to Apply

When adding a new gate:

1. Write `normalize_gate_input` (or reuse an existing helper).
2. Encode the rule as a positive allowlist membership check over
   normalized inputs.
3. For state-file gates, implement fail-closed semantics for
   parse errors, wrong types, and missing fields.
4. For path-transforming gates, enumerate the gate-action
   atomicity contract per "Gate-Action Atomicity for Validated
   Paths" — capture the transformed value and bind every
   downstream action to it.
5. In the plan, enumerate bypass variants explicitly in the
   Risks section.
6. Write the tests from the variant list, then the implementation.
7. Write a binary-level integration test that spawns the actual
   CLI with a prepared state file or CLI args — not just a unit
   test of the pure helper.

When reviewing an existing gate:

1. Grep for string comparisons in gate functions; confirm each
   comparison runs on normalized inputs.
2. Confirm the gate uses a positive allowlist for "permitted
   values" rather than a denylist for "forbidden values."
3. Confirm state-file reads fail CLOSED on parse errors and
   wrong types.
4. Confirm path-transforming gates pass the transformed value
   to every post-gate action — never the original input.
5. Confirm the binary-level integration test exists and covers
   the full decision matrix.
