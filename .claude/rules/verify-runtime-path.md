# Verify the Runtime Path

Before writing a fix, trace the actual execution path to confirm
where the code runs.

## Required Steps

1. **Find the real call site.** Grep for all callers. A function
   may exist in one file but be called from another — or not called
   at all if a different code path runs first.
2. **Verify runtime behavior.** Write a small diagnostic script
   that runs through the same call chain (Claude Code → bash →
   bin/flow → flow-rs) and print the actual values. Unit test
   mocks do not catch environment issues like missing ttys,
   wrong parents, or piped stdin.
3. **Check one layer deeper.** When a subprocess returns an
   unexpected value (`??`, empty string, wrong PID), investigate
   why before filtering it out. The wrong value is a symptom.

## Plan-phase extension for new production paths

The rule above applies to fixes, but it must also apply in the Plan
phase whenever a plan introduces a **new** execution path that a
production caller will take. Two shapes of this class:

**Shape A — new branch inside an existing function.** Adding a new
branch (a new `if` arm, a new `match` arm, a new early-return guard)
inside a function with a live production caller creates a path that
never ran before — and therefore has no coverage and no proof it
behaves as intended.

**Shape B — new callsite family introduced by a feature.** Adding a
new function, scanner, helper, or module and wiring it into multiple
existing entry points creates multiple production paths in the same
PR. Each invocation site is its own callsite audit row — the plan
must list every invocation point and name the test that exercises
it, not rely on a single "integration test" that happens to hit
one of them.

When the plan modifies a function OR introduces a new callsite
family, the plan must enumerate the callers and, for every row:

1. Record the conditions under which the caller hits the new code
   path.
2. Name the test that exercises the new path, using inputs that
   drive the caller's conditions (not a contrived unit-test
   fixture).
3. For callsite families, list every invocation point separately —
   never collapse multiple callsites into "the N callsites" or
   "all the integration sites" without enumerating each one by
   name and each one's test.

## Anti-Patterns

- Committing a fix without running it through the real path
- Adding a second fix on top of an unverified first fix
- Trusting unit tests as proof that runtime behavior is correct
  when the bug is environmental (process tree, tty, file system)
- Assuming which file creates/owns a piece of state without
  grepping for all writers
- Adding a new branch to a function without listing the production
  callers that will take it and the tests that prove the new paths
- Introducing a new scanner, hook, or helper family and describing
  the integration as a count ("the three callsites") without
  enumerating each callsite and its named test
