# Worktree Commands

## Use `git -C` instead of `cd && git`

Never use `cd <path> && git <command>`. Claude Code's built-in "bare
repository attacks" heuristic fires on any `cd <path> && git` compound
command, regardless of the allow list in settings.json.

Use `git -C <path> <command>` instead — it runs git in the target
directory without changing the shell's working directory, and it matches
a single permission pattern (`Bash(git -C *)`).

## Use dedicated tools instead of Bash for reads

Never use `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, or `find` via the Bash tool.
Use the Grep tool for content search, the Read tool for file contents,
and the Glob tool for file discovery. Dedicated tools never trigger
permission prompts.

## File tool paths must use the worktree

When working in a worktree (pwd contains `.worktrees/`), ALL file
tool paths (Edit, Read, Write, Grep, Glob) for repo-tracked files
must use the worktree absolute path from `pwd`, not the main repo
path. The worktree has its own copy of every tracked file. Editing
the main repo's copy does not affect the worktree.

Before every Edit or Write call, verify the path starts with the
current working directory (from `pwd`), not the project root from
`git worktree list`.

Shared paths that live OUTSIDE the worktree are fine to access
directly: `.flow-states/`, `~/.claude/`, plugin cache paths.

## Never invoke Python directly

Never run `python3` or `.venv/bin/python3` via the Bash tool.
Use `bin/flow`, `bin/ci`, or `bin/test` — they handle the venv
automatically and match existing permission patterns.
