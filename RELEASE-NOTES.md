# Release Notes

## v0.2.0 — Release Skill and Sub-Agent Architecture

### New Features

- `/flow:release` — New skill for versioned plugin releases. Bumps version in
  `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`, writes release notes, commits, tags,
  pushes, and creates a GitHub Release. Shows commits since last tag and
  recommends patch/minor/major based on commit analysis before asking for
  confirmation.

### Improvements

- **Mandatory sub-agents** — Research, Design, Plan, and Review phases now
  require Explore-type sub-agents to read the codebase. The main conversation
  stays clean for decisions; sub-agents do the reading and reporting.
- **Note capture at phase transitions** — Every phase transition (1–7) now
  offers a third option to capture a correction or learning before moving on.
- **Release skill step ordering** — Safety checks and commit list are shown
  before asking for the release type, so you see what changed before deciding.
- **`git log` always allowed** — Added `Bash(git log *)` to project permissions
  so read-only git introspection never prompts for approval.

### Fixes

- Removed Metaswarm and Superpowers phase comparison reference doc (outdated).

## v0.1.0 — Initial Release

The first public release of FLOW Process — an opinionated Ruby on Rails
development lifecycle plugin for Claude Code.

### What's Included

**8 Phase Skills**

Every feature follows the same phases in the same order:

1. `/flow:start` — Create worktree, upgrade gems, open PR, configure permissions
2. `/flow:research` — Explore codebase, ask clarifying questions, document findings
3. `/flow:design` — Propose 2-3 alternatives, get approval before any code
4. `/flow:plan` — Break design into ordered TDD tasks, section by section
5. `/flow:code` — TDD task by task, diff review, bin/ci gate before each commit
6. `/flow:review` — Design alignment, research risk coverage, Rails anti-pattern check
7. `/flow:reflect` — Extract learnings, update CLAUDE.md, note plugin gaps
8. `/flow:cleanup` — Remove worktree and delete state file

**4 Utility Skills**

Available at any point in the workflow:

- `/flow:commit` — Review diff, approve/deny, pull before push, commit
- `/flow:status` — Show current phase, PR link, timing, next step
- `/flow:resume` — Resume mid-session or rebuild from state on new session
- `/flow:note` — Capture corrections automatically when Claude is wrong

**Infrastructure**

- SessionStart hook — detects in-progress features, injects resume context
- Phase entry guards — prevents skipping phases
- Per-feature state files — `.claude/flow-states/<branch>.json`
- Git rebase denied in settings
- Documentation site (GitHub Pages with Jekyll)
