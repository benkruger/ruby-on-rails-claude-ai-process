# Phase 4: Review

**Command:** `/flow:review`

Systematic code review against the approved plan, identified risks,
and framework anti-patterns. `bin/flow ci` was already green from Code — Review
adds what automated tools cannot catch.

---

## What Review Checks

**1. Plan alignment**
Does the implementation match the approved plan? All change categories
verified against the plan file.

**2. Risk coverage**
Every risk identified in the plan confirmed as handled.
A risk found and not addressed is a bug waiting to happen.

**3. Framework anti-patterns**
Things `bin/flow ci` cannot catch — defined by the framework instructions in the skill. Each framework has its own anti-pattern checklist (e.g., N+1 queries and callback misuse for Rails; circular imports and mutable defaults for Python).

**4. Fresh read-through**
Every changed file read as if seeing it for the first time.
Clarity, naming, no over-engineering.

## Findings

- **Minor** — fixed directly in Review, committed, `bin/flow ci` re-run
- **Significant** — AskUserQuestion: fix here, go back to Code or Plan

## bin/flow ci Rule

`bin/flow ci` runs after every fix made during Review.
Review does not transition to Security until `bin/flow ci` is green.

## What Comes Next

Phase 5: Security (`/flow:security`) — scan for security issues in the
feature diff before the PR is merged.
