# Phase 5: Code

**Command:** `/flow:code`

Execute the approved plan task by task. Every task follows the same
cycle: architecture check, TDD, diff review, bin/ci, commit. Nothing
moves forward without the user approving the diff and bin/ci going green.

---

## The Task Loop

For each task in the plan, in order:

1. **Architecture check** — read what needs to be read before writing anything
2. **TDD cycle** — write failing test, confirm it fails, write code, confirm it passes, refactor
3. **Diff review** — show the changes, AskUserQuestion approval before bin/ci
4. **bin/ci** — must be green, 100% coverage
5. **`/flow:commit`** — commit this task
6. **Next task**

## Framework Testing Rules

Architecture checks and testing conventions are defined by the framework instructions in the skill. Each framework enforces its own rules (e.g., Rails requires test helpers and full class hierarchy reads; Python requires fixture checks and import analysis).

---

## Fast Test Feedback

During the TDD cycle, run the specific file for fast feedback:

The targeted test command is defined by the framework instructions (e.g., `bin/rails test <file>` for Rails, `bin/test <file>` for Python).

`bin/ci` only runs when the task is done and the diff is approved.

## Back Navigation

- **Go back to Plan** — task description is wrong or tasks are missing
- **Go back to Design** — the approach needs rethinking
- **Go back to Research** — something was missed that changes everything

---

## What You Get

By the end of Phase 5:

- Every planned task complete and committed
- Full TDD — every implementation has a test that was written first
- `bin/ci` green with 100% coverage
- All framework architecture standards followed

---

## What Comes Next

Phase 6: Review (`/flow:review`) — code review before merging.
