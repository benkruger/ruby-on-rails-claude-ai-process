# Phase 5: Complete

**Command:** `/flow-complete` or `/flow-complete --manual`

The final phase. Merges the PR into the integration branch (the
`base_branch` captured at flow-start — `main` for standard repos,
`staging`/`develop`/etc. for non-main-trunk repos), removes the git
worktree, and deletes the state file and log file. This is what fully
closes out a feature and resets the environment for the next one.

By default, skips confirmation and proceeds directly to merge and cleanup.
Use `--manual` to prompt for confirmation before the irreversible merge.
Best-effort on cleanup steps — warns if the state file is missing or
Phase 5 is incomplete.

## Steps

### 1. Run complete-fast

`complete-fast` consolidates phase entry, state detection, PR status
check, merge of the integration branch into the feature branch, local
CI dirty check, GitHub CI check, and squash merge into a single call. Returns a `path` field for dispatch:
`"merged"` (auto happy path), `"already_merged"`, `"confirm"` (manual
mode), `"ci_stale"`, `"ci_drift"`, `"ci_failed"`, `"ci_pending"`,
`"conflict"`, or `"max_retries"`. If the PR is already merged, skips
to finalize (step 6). If there are merge conflicts, resolves them and
self-invokes to continue.

The `ci_drift` path fires when the local CI sentinel matches the
current tree (the same bytes already passed `bin/flow ci` locally)
AND `gh pr checks` reports failure — a structural signal that the
developer toolchain and the CI runner have diverged
(formatter/linter/language-runtime version skew). The recovery is
deterministic and bypasses `ci-fixer`: refresh the local toolchain
via `bin/dependencies`, invalidate the sentinel and re-run via
`bin/flow ci --force`, commit any auto-fixes via
`/flow:flow-commit`, and self-invoke to re-check both local and
remote CI. If `bin/dependencies` is absent in the target project,
the handler dispatches as `ci_failed` and hands the failure to
`ci-fixer`. A second `ci_drift` detection in the same Complete
invocation is guarded by `_drift_recovery_attempted` and escalates
to the user because the cause is likely environmental (CI runtime
version, missing env var, or platform-specific behavior) rather
than something a toolchain bump can fix. See
`skills/flow-complete/SKILL.md` Step 1 for the full dispatch
sequence per `.claude/rules/docs-with-behavior.md`.

### 2. Run local CI gate

Runs `bin/flow ci` locally to catch test failures after merging the
integration branch into the feature branch.
If it fails, launch the ci-fixer sub-agent to diagnose and fix.

### 3. Check GitHub CI status

Checks the PR's GitHub CI checks via `gh pr checks`. If all pass,
continue to merge. If any are pending, invoke
`/loop 15s /flow:flow-complete` to auto-retry. If any have failed,
launch the ci-fixer sub-agent to diagnose and fix.

### 4. Confirm with user (--manual only)

When `--manual` is passed, explicit confirmation is required before
the irreversible squash merge. Any warnings from the preflight are
included in the confirmation message. Skipped by default.

### 5. Merge PR

`complete-merge` handles the freshness check and squash merge in a
single script call. Verifies the branch is up-to-date with the
integration branch before merging. If the integration branch has
moved, merges the new commits and loops back to step 2 (CI gate) to
re-test. A retry limit of 3 prevents
infinite loops under high contention. Once up-to-date, squash-merges
via `gh pr merge --squash`. Detects branch protection policy blocks
and returns for CI wait.

### 6. Finalize: post-merge + cleanup

`complete-finalize` handles all post-merge work AND cleanup in a single
best-effort call. Self-gates before any side effect: when the caller's
canonicalized cwd equals or sits beneath the canonicalized `--worktree`
argument, the command returns
`{"status":"error","reason":"cwd_inside_worktree"}` instead of removing
the worktree, so a missed `cd <project_root>` produces a clean error
rather than stranding the shell in a deleted directory.

- Phase transition complete (records timing)
- PR body rendering (What, Artifacts, Plan, DAG Analysis, Phase
  Timings, Token Cost, Review Findings, Learn Findings, State File,
  Session Log, Issues Filed)
- Close referenced GitHub issues from the start prompt
- Generate business-friendly summary (feature name, prompt,
  per-phase timeline, artifact counts)
- Remove "Flow In-Progress" labels
- Auto-close parent issues and milestones
- Post Slack notification
- Worktree tmp directory removal, worktree removal, remote and
  local branch deletion, and deletion of the state file, plan file,
  DAG file, log file, frozen-phases file, CI sentinel, timings
  file, closed-issues file, issues file, and adversarial test file
  (glob-matched as `.flow-states/<branch>/adversarial_test.*`),
  followed by `git pull origin <base_branch>` (the integration branch)
- Integration-branch sentinel write: when `--pull` was passed AND
  the pull completed cleanly, writes
  `<root>/.flow-states/<base_branch>/ci-passed` from
  `ci::tree_snapshot(&root, None)`. The post-merge local tree is
  byte-identical to the feature-branch tip whose CI passed, so the
  sentinel is honest by construction. The next `start-gate` sees
  the snapshot match and skips CI entirely.

Each cleanup step is best-effort — if one fails, the rest still run.

### 7. Cleanup results

Reports what `complete-finalize` cleaned up in Step 6: what was
removed, what was already gone, and what failed.

## What You Get

By the end of Phase 5:

- PR squash-merged into the integration branch
- Referenced GitHub issues closed (extracted from the start prompt)
- Remote branch auto-deleted by GitHub after merge
- Worktree and all its contents removed
- Business-friendly summary displayed in Done banner: feature name, prompt,
  per-phase timeline, and artifact counts (issues filed, notes captured)
- PR link displayed in Done banner for quick access
- State file deleted — no more session hook injection for this feature
- Log file deleted — no stale logs left behind
- Local integration branch pulled up to date with the merged feature code
- Local environment clean and ready for the next feature

## Idempotent Design

The skill is safe to re-invoke (e.g., via `/loop 15s /flow:flow-complete`):

| State | Behavior |
|---|---|
| PR already merged | Runs finalize (post-merge + cleanup) |
| Main already merged into branch | No-op merge |
| CI already passing | Skips to merge |
| Freshness retry in progress | Loops back through CI gate, respects retry limit |
| State file already deleted | Exits cleanly |

---

## Best-Effort Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| State file exists, Learn (Phase 4) complete | Normal merge and cleanup — no warnings |
| State file exists, Learn (Phase 4) incomplete | Warns, proceeds (confirms if `--manual`) |
| State file missing | Warns, infers from git, proceeds (confirms if `--manual`) |
| PR not open or merged | Hard block, does not proceed |

Every operation inside `complete-finalize` (Step 6) is best-effort — if
one fails, continue to the next.

---

## Gates

- PR must be open or already merged — hard block if closed
- Learn (Phase 4) complete is a warning, not a hard block
- Missing state file is a warning, not a hard block
- CI must pass before merge
- Confirmation only when `--manual` is passed
- Steps 1-5 run from the worktree; Step 6 (finalize) runs from the project root
