# Reflection Process

Shared process used by both `/reflect` (maintainer) and `/flow:reflect` (Phase 7).
Each calling skill gathers its own evidence, then follows these steps.

## Step A — Synthesize findings

Before asking the user anything, organize all gathered evidence into four
categories:

**Process violations** — existing rules in CLAUDE.md that were broken or
nearly broken during the session. Quote the specific rule.

**Claude mistakes** — things Claude got wrong that the user had to correct.
Be specific and honest. Name the mistake clearly — do not soften or hedge.

**Missing rules** — situations where Claude did the wrong thing but no
existing rule covered it. These are gaps in CLAUDE.md.

**Process gaps** — places where the development process itself (tools,
skills, workflows) should be improved. These are not CLAUDE.md rules —
they are process changes.

---

## Step B — Present findings

Present the synthesis to the user in a banner:

````
```
============================================
  Reflect — Findings
============================================

  Process violations
  ------------------
  - CLAUDE.md says "never use guard clauses" but Claude
    added an early return in the worker
  - ...

  Claude mistakes
  ---------------
  - Suggested git rebase (forbidden — corrected immediately)
  - ...

  Missing rules
  -------------
  - No rule about checking eager-loaded associations
    before using pluck
  - ...

  Process gaps
  ------------
  - /flow:commit should warn when branch is behind
  - ...

============================================
```
````

Then use AskUserQuestion:

> "Does this capture what went wrong? Anything I missed or got wrong?"
> - **Yes, this is accurate** — proceed to proposals
> - **Needs corrections** — describe what to change

If "Needs corrections", revise and re-present until accurate.

---

## Step C — Propose CLAUDE.md additions

For each item in "Missing rules", propose a specific addition to CLAUDE.md.

**Writing rules for CLAUDE.md:**
- Write for Claude, not for humans — the audience is a future Claude session
- Be direct, specific, and actionable — describe the exact situation and the
  exact required behavior
- One to three sentences maximum
- Generic and reusable — not tied to the specific feature or session
- Placed in the correct section of the target CLAUDE.md

Present each proposal individually using AskUserQuestion:

> "Proposed CLAUDE.md addition:
> '[proposed text]'
> Section: [target section]"
> - **Yes, add it**
> - **Yes, but rephrase** — describe how
> - **No, skip this one**

For "Yes, but rephrase" — revise and confirm before collecting.

Collect all approved additions. Do not apply yet.

---

## Step D — Strengthen violated rules

For each item in "Process violations", evaluate whether the existing rule's
language was clear enough. If the violation happened because the rule was
ambiguous or easy to overlook, propose a rewording.

Present each rewording proposal individually using AskUserQuestion (same
three options as Step C).

Collect all approved rewordings. Do not apply yet.

---

## Step E — Apply approved changes

Read the target CLAUDE.md. Apply all approved additions and rewordings.
Do not duplicate existing content.

Then commit via the appropriate commit skill — `/commit` for maintainer,
`/flow:commit` for FLOW features.

Only CLAUDE.md and `.claude/` files are committed — never application code.

## Hard Rules

- Never skip evidence gathering — always read sources before presenting
- Never propose vague rules — every addition must describe the specific
  situation and the specific required behavior
- Be honest about Claude's mistakes — name them clearly, do not soften
- Write CLAUDE.md entries for Claude, not for humans
- Every CLAUDE.md change approved individually
- Commit via the appropriate commit skill
