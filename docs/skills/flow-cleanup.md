# /flow:cleanup

**Phase:** 8 — Cleanup

**Usage:** `/flow:cleanup`

The final phase. Removes the git worktree and deletes the state file.
Best-effort — warns if the state file is missing or Phase 7 is incomplete,
but proceeds after user confirmation.

---

## What It Does

1. Reads `.flow-states/<branch>.json` for worktree and feature name
   (or infers from git state if the file is missing)
2. Confirms with the user before any destructive action, including any
   warnings from the entry check
3. Runs the cleanup process:
   navigate to root, remove worktree, delete state file and log, report results

---

## Why State File Deletion Matters

Deleting `.flow-states/<branch>.json` is what resets the
SessionStart hook. Without it, every new session would detect a
feature in progress that no longer exists. This is the clean exit
from the FLOW workflow.

---

## Best-Effort Behavior

Cleanup handles three scenarios gracefully:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| State file exists, Phase 7 complete | Normal cleanup — no warnings |
| State file exists, Phase 7 incomplete | Warns, proceeds after confirmation |
| State file missing | Warns, infers from git state, proceeds after confirmation |

Every step after user confirmation is best-effort. If worktree removal
fails (already removed), it continues to state file deletion. If the
state file doesn't exist, it notes that and finishes.

## Gates

- Phase 7 complete is a warning, not a hard block
- Missing state file is a warning, not a hard block
- Requires explicit user confirmation before removing the worktree
- Must run from the project root — never from inside the worktree
- Worktree removal is irreversible
