# /flow:code

**Phase:** 5 — Code

**Usage:** `/flow:code`

Executes the approved plan one task at a time. Each task goes through
a full TDD cycle, user diff review, bin/ci gate, and commit before
the next task begins.

---

## The Loop

For each task:

1. Architecture check (read full hierarchy, find test helpers)
2. Write failing test → confirm it fails
3. Write code → confirm test passes → refactor
4. Show diff → AskUserQuestion review
5. bin/ci green (required)
6. `/flow:commit` for this task
7. Next task

## Rails Architecture Enforced

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Test helpers | Always `create_*!` from `test/support/` — never direct creation |
| Model changes | Read full class hierarchy before touching any model |
| Callbacks | Check parent classes — callbacks silently overwrite values |
| Workers | Check `config/sidekiq.yml` for correct queue |
| Updates | Always `update!` — never `update_column` |

---

## Test Runs

- **During TDD**: `bin/rails test <specific_file>` — fast feedback
- **Before commit**: `bin/ci` — full suite, must be green
- **End of phase**: `coverage/uncovered.txt` must be empty

---

## Gates

- Test must fail before writing implementation
- User approves diff before bin/ci runs
- bin/ci must be green before every commit
- 100% coverage before transitioning to Review
- Never rebase
