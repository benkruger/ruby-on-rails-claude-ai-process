# /flow-code

**Phase:** 2 — Code

**Usage:** `/flow-code`, `/flow-code --auto`, `/flow-code --manual`, or `/flow-code --continue-step`

Executes the approved plan one task at a time. Each task goes through
a full TDD cycle, user diff review, `bin/flow ci` gate, and commit before
the next task begins.

---

## One Task Per Invocation

Each skill invocation executes exactly one task. After committing, the
skill self-invokes (`--continue-step`) to handle the next task in a
fresh invocation. The `code_task` field in the state file tracks progress
and is validated to increment by exactly 1 — preventing task batching.

For the current task:

1. Architecture check (read full hierarchy, find test helpers)
2. Write failing test → confirm it fails
3. Write code → confirm test passes → refactor
4. Show diff → AskUserQuestion review (streamline available after first task)
5. `bin/flow ci` green (required)
6. Plan test verification — confirm all plan-named test functions exist
7. `/flow-commit` for this task
8. Self-invoke for next task

---

## Atomic Task Groups

When tasks form a circular CI dependency (e.g., adding a new CI check and
fixing its violations in the same PR), no intermediate state can pass
`bin/flow ci` independently. The plan marks these tasks as an **atomic
group** with the reason they cannot be committed individually.

All tasks in the group are executed sequentially — each gets a full TDD
cycle and its own `code_task` increment — but `bin/flow ci` and commit
happen once after the last task. The `code_task` counter still increments
by exactly 1 per task; only the commit is deferred. For efficiency, batch
all counter advances in a single `set-timestamp` call with multiple
`--set code_task=N` arguments — `apply_updates` validates each step
sequentially against the in-memory state.

---

## Measurement-Only Tasks

Some plan tasks produce no file changes — a final coverage TOTAL capture
for the PR body, a threshold verification re-run, or a final regression
re-run the plan names explicitly. The Code phase still routes these
through `/flow-commit`, which detects the empty diff, prints "Nothing to
commit", and returns to the caller without running `finalize-commit`.
The `code_task` counter advances normally and the self-invocation at the
end of the Commit sequence fires unchanged, so every task — file-changing
or not — flows through the same commit funnel and honors the "All commits
via `/flow-commit`" convention.

## Project Architecture Enforced

Architecture checks are defined by the project's CLAUDE.md. Each project documents its own conventions for reading code before writing, using test infrastructure correctly, and following its own architecture rules.

---

## Test Runs

- **During TDD**: targeted test command via `bin/test --file <path>` — fast feedback
- **Before commit**: `bin/flow ci` — full suite, must be green
- **End of phase**: 100% coverage enforced by `bin/flow ci`'s `--fail-under-lines/regions/functions 100` gate

---

## Mode

Mode is configurable via `.flow.json` (default: manual). In auto mode, streamline is active from task 1 (skip per-task approval, still show diffs) and the phase transition advances to Review without asking.

---

## Gates

- Test must fail before writing implementation
- Diff is always shown for every task (in both modes)
- `bin/flow ci` must be green before every commit
- 100% coverage before transitioning to Review
- Never rebase
