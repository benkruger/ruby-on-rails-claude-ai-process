# /flow-complete

**Phase:** 5 — Complete

**Usage:** `/flow-complete`, `/flow-complete --auto`, `/flow-complete --manual`, or `/flow-complete --continue-step`

The final phase. Merges the PR into the integration branch (`base_branch`),
removes the git worktree, and deletes the state file. Mode is configurable
via `.flow.json`
(default: auto, skips confirmation). Use `--manual` to prompt for
confirmation before the irreversible merge. The `--continue-step`
flag is used for self-invocation after mid-phase commits (merge
conflict resolution or CI fix) — it skips the Announce banner and
SOFT-GATE and dispatches via the Resume Check.

## What It Does

1. **Run complete-fast** — consolidates phase entry, state detection, PR
   status check, merge of the integration branch into the feature branch,
   local CI dirty check, GitHub CI check, and squash merge into a single call. Returns a `path` field for dispatch:
   `"merged"` (auto happy path), `"already_merged"`, `"confirm"` (manual
   mode), `"ci_stale"`, `"ci_drift"`, `"ci_failed"`, `"ci_pending"`,
   `"conflict"`, or `"max_retries"`. `ci_drift` fires when local CI
   passed on the current tree but GitHub CI failed (toolchain version
   drift); recovery refreshes the local toolchain via `bin/dependencies`,
   invalidates the sentinel via `bin/flow ci --force`, commits auto-fixes,
   and self-invokes. If the PR is already merged, skips to finalize (step 6)
2. **Local CI gate** — `bin/flow ci` catches test failures after merging
   the integration branch into the feature branch. If it fails, ci-fixer
   commits a fix and self-invokes to re-check
3. **GitHub CI check** — `gh pr checks` waits for checks to pass. If pending,
   invokes `/loop` to auto-retry. If failed, ci-fixer commits a fix
4. **Confirm** (manual mode only) — explicit confirmation before the
   irreversible merge. Offers approve, decline, or feedback options. Skipped
   by default
5. **Merge** — `complete-merge` handles the freshness check and squash merge.
   If the integration branch moved, loops back through CI. Detects branch
   protection policy blocks and merge conflicts
6. **Finalize** — `complete-finalize` handles phase completion, PR body
   rendering, issues summary, closing referenced issues, summary generation,
   label removal, auto-close parent issues, Slack notification, worktree
   removal, state/log deletion, and git pull — all best-effort in a single
   call
7. **Cleanup results** — reports what `complete-finalize` cleaned up: what
   was removed, what was already gone, and what failed

## Why State File Deletion Matters

Deleting `.flow-states/<branch>/state.json` is the clean exit from the
FLOW workflow. It removes the branch-scoped state that other FLOW
commands (phase gates, status, TUI) rely on to detect an active flow.

---

## Idempotent Design

The skill is safe to re-invoke (e.g., via `/loop 15s /flow:flow-complete`).
Each step checks its precondition and skips if already done: merged PRs
skip to finalize, up-to-date branches skip the merge, passing CI skips
the wait. After finalize completes, the next invocation finds no state
file and exits cleanly.

---

## Best-Effort Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| State file exists, Learn (Phase 4) complete | Normal merge and cleanup — no warnings |
| State file exists, Learn (Phase 4) incomplete | Warns, proceeds (confirms if `--manual`) |
| State file missing | Warns, infers from git state, proceeds (confirms if `--manual`) |
| PR closed but not merged | Hard block, does not proceed |

Every operation inside `complete-finalize` (Step 6) is best-effort. If
label removal or issue closing fails, it continues to cleanup. If the
state file doesn't exist, it notes that and finishes.

## Gates

- PR must be open or already merged — hard block if closed
- CI must pass before merge
- Learn (Phase 4) complete is a warning, not a hard block
- Missing state file is a warning, not a hard block
- Confirmation only when mode is manual (via `--manual` or `.flow.json`)
- Steps 1-5 run from the worktree; Step 6 (finalize) runs from the project root
- Merge is irreversible; branch and worktree deletion is handled by `complete-finalize`
- If merge fails, stop and report — never retry with additional flags or elevated privileges
