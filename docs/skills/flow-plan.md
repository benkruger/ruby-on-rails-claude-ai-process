# /flow-plan

**Phase:** 2 — Plan

**Usage:** `/flow-plan`, `/flow-plan --auto`, or `/flow-plan --manual`

Explores the codebase, designs the approach, and produces an ordered
implementation plan using Claude Code's native plan mode. Replaces the
former Research, Design, and Plan phases with a single integrated phase.

---

## What It Does

1. Reads the feature description from the `prompt` field in the state file
   (the full text passed to `/flow-start`)
2. Enters Claude Code's native plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`)
3. In plan mode: explores the codebase, identifies risks, designs the
   approach, and writes the plan to a plan file
4. User iterates directly with the plan via plan mode's revision loop
5. Stores the plan file path in the state file, adds the session log artifact
   to the PR (when transcript path is available), then calls `ExitPlanMode`
6. Completes the phase and transitions to Code

---

## Plan File Structure

The plan file lives at `~/.claude/plans/<name>.md` and includes:

- **Context** — what the user wants to build and why
- **Exploration** — what exists in the codebase, affected files, patterns
- **Risks** — what could go wrong, edge cases, constraints
- **Approach** — the chosen approach and rationale
- **Tasks** — ordered implementation tasks with files and TDD notes

---

## Resuming

If the session breaks mid-plan, `/flow-continue` checks whether
`plan_file` is already set in the state file. If set, the plan was
already approved — the phase completes and transitions to Code.
If not set, the plan mode flow restarts.

---

## Mode

Mode is configurable via `.flow.json` (default: manual) under `skills.flow-plan.continue`. In auto mode, the phase transition advances to Code without asking. Flags `--auto` and `--manual` override the configured mode.

---

## Gates

- Requires Phase 1: Start to be complete
- Plan mode approval required before proceeding to Code
- Plan file path must be stored in state before phase completion
