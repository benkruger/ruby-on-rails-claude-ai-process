# /flow-prime

**Phase:** Any (run once per install/upgrade)

**Usage:** `/flow-prime`

One-time project setup. Configures workspace permissions in `.claude/settings.json`, sets up git excludes, and writes a version marker. Run once after installing FLOW and again after each upgrade.

---

## What It Does

1. Auto-detects framework using data-driven detection (`frameworks/*/detect.json`) and confirms with the user
2. Asks the user to choose an autonomy level (fully autonomous, fully manual, recommended, or customize per skill)
3. Asks the user to choose a commit message format (title-only or full)
4. Runs a single setup script that handles all configuration in one call:
   - Reads or creates `.claude/settings.json` and merges FLOW allow/deny permissions (universal + framework-specific)
   - Writes `.flow.json` with version, framework, config hash, commit format, and skills configuration
   - Adds `.flow-states/`, `.worktrees/`, `.flow.json`, and `bin/dependencies` to `.git/info/exclude`
   - Installs a pre-commit hook that blocks direct `git commit` during active FLOW features and requires `/flow:flow-commit`
   - Primes the project CLAUDE.md with framework conventions from `frameworks/<name>/priming.md`
   - Creates `bin/dependencies` from the framework template
5. Installs the `code-review` plugin from the `anthropics/claude-code` marketplace
6. Commits `.claude/settings.json` and `.flow.json`

## Autonomy Configuration

FLOW has two independent axes for skills that support them:

- **Commit** — how `/flow-commit` is invoked during phase work (auto = skip diff approval, manual = require approval). Also controls per-task approval in Code.
- **Continue** — whether to auto-advance to the next phase or prompt first.

The chosen configuration is stored in `.flow.json` under a `skills` key:

```json
{
  "flow_version": "0.16.4",
  "framework": "python",
  "skills": {
    "flow-start": {"continue": "manual"},
    "flow-plan": {"continue": "auto"},
    "flow-code": {"commit": "manual", "continue": "manual"},
    "flow-code-review": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"},
    "flow-learn": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"},
    "flow-abort": "auto",
    "flow-complete": "auto"
  }
}
```

Phase skills that commit (Code, Code Review, Learn) have both axes as a nested object. Phase skills that don't commit (Start, Plan) have only the continue axis. Utility skills (Abort, Complete) have a single string value. The `/flow-commit` skill is not configurable — it defaults to auto and can be overridden with `--manual`.

Individual skills can always be overridden at invocation time with `--auto` or `--manual` flags, regardless of the `.flow.json` configuration.

## Gates

- Must be in a git repository
- Must be on the main branch (permissions are committed and shared with the team)
