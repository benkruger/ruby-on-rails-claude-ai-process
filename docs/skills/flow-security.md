# /flow:security

**Phase:** 6 — Security

**Usage:** `/flow:security`, `/flow:security --auto`, or `/flow:security --manual`

Security analysis of the feature diff. Uses an Explore sub-agent
to run 10 security checks, then fixes every confirmed finding
one at a time with a commit per fix.

---

## What It Checks

The 10 security checks are defined by the framework instructions in the skill. Each framework has its own checklist tailored to common vulnerability patterns (e.g., authorization gaps and CSRF bypass for Rails; command injection and path traversal for Python).

---

## Fixing Findings

Every confirmed finding gets fixed directly:

1. Fix one finding
2. Run `bin/flow ci`
3. Commit via `/flow:commit`
4. Mark finding as fixed in state
5. Next finding

---

## Mode

Mode is configurable via `.flow.json` (default: auto). In auto mode, the phase transition advances to Reflect without asking. Security analysis and fixing behavior is the same in both modes.

---

## Gates

- Phase 5: Review must be complete
- `bin/flow ci` must be green after every fix
- `bin/flow ci` must be green before transitioning to Reflect
- Full diff must be read before analysis begins
