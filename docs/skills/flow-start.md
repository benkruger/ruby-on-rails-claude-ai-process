# /flow:start

**Phase:** 1 — Start

**Usage:** `/flow:start <feature name words>` or `/flow:start --light <feature name words>`

**Example:** `/flow:start app payment webhooks`

**Light mode example:** `/flow:start --light fix login bug`

Begins a new feature. This is always the first command run for any piece of work. It sets up an isolated environment, ensures dependencies are current, and establishes the PR before any feature code is written.

**Prerequisite:** `/flow:init` must be run once per project (and again after each FLOW upgrade) before `/flow:start` will work. The setup script checks for a matching version marker at `.flow.json`.

## What It Does

1. Checks for existing active FLOW features
2. Runs `bin/flow ci` on main to verify the codebase is healthy
3. Runs `lib/start-setup.py` — verifies `/flow:init` version gate, git pull, worktree creation, empty commit + push + PR, and state file creation
4. Framework-specific setup (Rails: gem upgrade, post-upgrade `bin/flow ci`, CI fixes via a Sonnet sub-agent, commit. Python: no additional setup)
5. Marks Phase 1 complete and transitions to Phase 2: Research

---

## Naming

Words after `/flow:start` are joined with hyphens to form the feature name:

| Part | Value |
|------|-------|
| Branch | `app-payment-webhooks` |
| Worktree | `.worktrees/app-payment-webhooks` |
| PR title | `App Payment Webhooks` |

Branch names are capped at 32 characters, truncated at word boundaries.

## Gates

- Stops immediately if no feature name is provided
- Stops if `bin/flow ci` fails on main before creating worktree
- Stops if `git pull` fails
- Will not proceed past dependency upgrade until `bin/flow ci` is green
- Escalates to the user if `bin/flow ci` cannot be fixed after three attempts

---

## Light Mode

When invoked with `--light`, Start sets `mode: "light"` in the state file and
marks Phase 3: Design as complete and skipped. The `--light` flag is not
included in the branch name.

Light mode is designed for bug fixes and small changes that do not need full
Design ceremony. Research writes a simplified design object directly, and the
workflow transitions from Research to Plan (skipping Design).
