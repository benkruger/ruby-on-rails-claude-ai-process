# /flow-status

**Phase:** Any

**Usage:** `/flow-status`

Shows where you are in the FLOW workflow at any moment. Reads `.flow-states/<branch>.json` and prints a clear picture of what has been completed and what comes next. Read-only — never modifies any files.

---

## What It Does

1. Reads `.flow-states/<branch>.json` from the project root
2. Prints a status panel with current phase, timing, and next command
