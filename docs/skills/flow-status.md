# /flow:status

**Phase:** Any

**Usage:** `/flow:status`

Shows where you are in the FLOW workflow at any moment. Reads `.claude/flow-states/<branch>.json` and prints a clear picture of what has been completed and what comes next. Rebuilds the Claude task list from persisted state.

---

## What It Does

1. Reads `.claude/flow-states/<branch>.json` from the project root
2. Rebuilds the task list using TaskCreate for each phase
3. Prints a status panel with current phase, timing, and next command
