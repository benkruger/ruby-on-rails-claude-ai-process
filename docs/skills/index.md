# Skills

Skills are the building blocks of the FLOW workflow. Some are tied to a specific phase and invoked automatically as part of that phase. Others are utility skills available at any point.

All skills are namespaced under `flow:` and announce themselves clearly when they start and finish.

## Phase Skills

These skills correspond directly to a workflow phase. Each one starts and ends with a banner so you always know where you are.

| Skill | Phase | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| [`/flow:start`](flow-start.md) | 1 — Start | Create the worktree, upgrade gems, open the PR, configure permissions |
| [`/flow:research`](flow-research.md) | 2 — Research | Explore codebase, ask clarifying questions, document findings |
| [`/flow:design`](flow-design.md) | 3 — Design | Propose 2-3 alternatives, get approval before any code |
| [`/flow:plan`](flow-plan.md) | 4 — Plan | Break design into ordered TDD tasks, section by section |
| [`/flow:code`](flow-code.md) | 5 — Code | TDD task by task, diff review, bin/ci gate before each commit |
| [`/flow:review`](flow-review.md) | 6 — Review | Design alignment, research risk coverage, Rails anti-pattern check |
| [`/flow:reflect`](flow-reflect.md) | 7 — Reflect | Extract learnings, update CLAUDE.md, note plugin gaps |
| [`/flow:cleanup`](flow-cleanup.md) | 8 — Cleanup | Remove worktree and delete state file — final phase |

## Utility Skills

These skills are available at any point in the workflow, regardless of phase.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`/flow:commit`](flow-commit.md) | Review the full diff, approve or deny, then git add + commit + push |
| [`/flow:status`](flow-status.md) | Show current phase, PR link, phase checklist, and what comes next |
| [`/flow:resume`](flow-resume.md) | Resume current feature — re-asks last transition question or rebuilds from state |
| [`/flow:note`](flow-note.md) | Capture a correction or learning — invoked automatically on corrections |
| [`/flow:release`](flow-release.md) | Bump version, tag, push, create GitHub Release (maintainer-only) |
