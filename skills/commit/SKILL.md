# FLOW Commit

Review all pending changes as a diff before committing. You must get explicit approval before touching git.

## Announce

At the very start, print inside a fenced code block (triple backticks) so it renders as plain monospace text and not as a markdown heading:

````
```
============================================
  FLOW — flow:commit — STARTING
  Recommended model: Sonnet
============================================
```
````

On completion (whether approved or denied), print the same way:

````
```
============================================
  FLOW — flow:commit — COMPLETE
============================================
```
````

## Logging

Wrap every Bash command with timestamps in the **same Bash call** — no
separate calls for logging:

```bash
echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) [Commit] Step X — desc — START" >> /tmp/flow-<branch>.log; COMMAND; EC=$?; echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) [Commit] Step X — desc — DONE (exit $EC)" >> /tmp/flow-<branch>.log; exit $EC
```

Get `<branch>` from `git branch --show-current`. The gap between DONE
and the next START = Claude's processing time.

## Process

Follow the commit process in `docs/commit-process.md` (Steps 1 through 5).

## Additional Rules

- If `bin/ci` has not been run since the last code change, warn the user before asking for approval
