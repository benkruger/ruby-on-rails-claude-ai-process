# FLOW Cleanup — Phase 8: Cleanup

## Usage

```text
/flow:flow-cleanup
/flow:flow-cleanup --auto
/flow:flow-cleanup --manual
```

- `/flow:flow-cleanup` — uses configured mode from `.flow.json` (default: auto)
- `/flow:flow-cleanup --auto` — skips confirmation and proceeds directly to cleanup
- `/flow:flow-cleanup --manual` — prompts for user confirmation before any destructive action

## Mode Resolution

1. If `--auto` was passed → mode is **auto**
2. If `--manual` was passed → mode is **manual**
3. Otherwise, read `.flow.json` from the project root. Use `skills.flow-cleanup` value.
4. If `.flow.json` has no `skills` key → use built-in default: **auto**

<SOFT-GATE>
Run this entry check as your very first action. This gate never
blocks — it records warnings for the confirmation step.

1. Find the project root: run `git worktree list --porcelain` and note the
   path on the first `worktree` line.
2. Get the current branch: run `git branch --show-current`.
3. Use the Read tool to read `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>.json`.
   - If the file exists: extract `feature`, `worktree`, and
     `cumulative_seconds`. Check `phases.flow-learning.status` — if not `"complete"`,
     record warning "Phase 7 not complete (status: <actual status>)."
   - If the file does not exist: record warning "No state file found for
     branch '<branch>'."

Use these values for all subsequent steps — do not re-read the state file
or re-run git commands to gather the same information.

Carry any warnings forward to the confirmation step in Step 2.

Resolve the mode using the Mode Resolution rules above.

## Announce

At the very start, output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
============================================
  FLOW v0.18.0 — Phase 8: Cleanup — STARTING
============================================
```
````

## Logging

No logging for this phase. Cleanup deletes the log file as part of its
operation — writing log entries that are immediately deleted is pointless.

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Handle missing state file

This step only runs if the SOFT-GATE found no state file. If the state
file existed, the SOFT-GATE already extracted all needed values — skip
to Step 2.

Infer what you can:
- `branch` from `git branch --show-current` (already known from the gate)
- Detect worktree path from `git worktree list`
- Use the branch name as the feature name

Tell the user what was inferred:
> "No state file found. Inferring from git: branch '<branch>',
> worktree '<path>'."

### Step 2 — Check PR merge status

Verify the PR has been merged before allowing cleanup.

If the state file had a `pr_number`, run:

```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --json state --jq .state
```

If the state file had no `pr_number` (or no state file was found), try the branch name:

```bash
gh pr view <branch> --json state --jq .state
```

If the result is `MERGED`, continue to Step 3.

If the result is anything else (e.g., `OPEN`, `CLOSED`), stop:

> "Your PR must be merged before cleanup. Current PR status: **<state>**.
> Merge the PR first, then run `/flow:flow-cleanup` again."

If both commands fail (no PR found), stop:

> "Could not find a PR for this branch. Merge your PR first, then run
> `/flow:flow-cleanup` again."

### Step 3 — Confirm with user (manual mode only)

Skip this step if mode is **auto** — proceed directly to Step 4.

If mode is **manual**, this phase is destructive and irreversible. Use AskUserQuestion.

If the SOFT-GATE printed warnings, include them in the confirmation so
the user knows what's off before confirming:

> "Ready to clean up feature '<feature>'?
> ⚠ <any warnings from the gate>
> This will remove the worktree and delete the state file and log permanently."

- **Yes, clean up** — proceed
- **No, not yet** — stop here

If there were no warnings:

> "Ready to clean up feature '<feature>'?
> This will remove the worktree and delete the state file and log permanently."

- **Yes, clean up** — proceed
- **No, not yet** — stop here

### Step 4 — Run cleanup script

Run the cleanup script from the project root:

```bash
exec ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow cleanup <project_root> --branch <branch> --worktree <worktree_path>
```

The script outputs JSON with a `steps` dict showing what happened to each resource (worktree, state\_file, log\_file). Each step reports "removed"/"deleted", "skipped", or "failed: reason".

Report the results to the user: what was cleaned, what was already gone, and what failed.

### Step 5 — Pull merged changes

The worktree is removed and you are on main. Pull to get the merged
feature code:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

If the pull fails, warn the user but do not block — cleanup succeeded.

### Done — Print banner

For the banner below, compute `<formatted_time>` from the integer `cumulative_seconds` read in Step 1: `Xh Ym` if ≥ 3600, `Xm` if ≥ 60, `<1m` if < 60. Do not write the formatted string back to the state file.

Output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
============================================
  FLOW v0.18.0 — Phase 8: Cleanup — COMPLETE (<formatted_time>)
  Feature '<feature>' is fully done.
  Worktree removed, state file and log deleted.
============================================
```
````

## Rules

- Never run from inside the worktree — always navigate to project root first
- Confirm with the user only when mode is **manual**
- State file deletion is what resets the session hook — do not skip it
- Every step after confirmation is best-effort — if one fails, continue to the next
- Never use Bash to print banners — output them as text in your response
- Never use Bash for file reads — use Glob, Read, and Grep tools instead of ls, cat, head, tail, find, or grep
- Never use `cd <path> && git` — use `git -C <path>` for git commands in other directories
- Never cd before running `bin/flow` — it detects the project root internally
