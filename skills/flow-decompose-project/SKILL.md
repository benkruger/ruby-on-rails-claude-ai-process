# Flow Decompose Project

Decompose a large project into many GitHub issues with native sub-issue
relationships, blocked-by dependencies, milestones, and phase labels.
Produces a fully linked issue graph ready for autonomous execution via
`/flow:flow-start` or `/flow:flow-orchestrate`.

## Usage

```text
/flow:flow-decompose-project <project description>
/flow:flow-decompose-project --step 2 --id <id>
/flow:flow-decompose-project --step 3 --id <id>
/flow:flow-decompose-project --step 4 --id <id>
/flow:flow-decompose-project --step 5 --id <id>
/flow:flow-decompose-project --step 6 --id <id>
```

- `/flow:flow-decompose-project <project description>` — start from Step 1
- `/flow:flow-decompose-project --step N --id <id>` — self-invocation: resume at Step N

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT proceed if no arguments were provided after the command (excluding flags).
Output this error message and stop:

> "Project description required. Usage: `/flow:flow-decompose-project <project description>`"

No interactive prompt. The user re-runs the command with arguments.

</HARD-GATE>

## Concurrency

This skill creates shared GitHub state (issues, milestones, labels,
sub-issue relationships, dependencies). Session state is tracked in
`.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>.json` with a unique ID per session
to prevent concurrent collisions. Issue creation is idempotent by title.

## Step Dispatch

If `--step N --id <id>` was passed, this is a self-invocation from a
previous step. The `--id` flag carries the session-scoped identifier
generated in Step 1. Skip the Announce banner and jump directly to the
Resume Check, using the provided `<id>` for all file paths.

If no `--step` flag was passed, proceed to Announce and then Step 1.

## Announce

At the very start, output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  FLOW v1.1.0 — flow:flow-decompose-project — STARTING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
```
````

Immediately after the banner, write the per-session "utility skill
in progress" marker so the Stop hook refuses turn-end while this
skill is running. Without the marker the model returns control to
the user when the decompose:decompose Skill tool returns
mid-pipeline at Step 1, breaking the unattended-flow contract this
skill promises across its six-step chain.

Rust resolves the active session_id at the CLI boundary by reading
the `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` env var Claude Code supplies to every
Bash subprocess (Claude Code 2.1.132+); on older Claude Code
installs it falls back to the SessionStart capture file. On
2.1.132+ the per-subprocess env value matches what the Stop hook
receives in its stdin payload, so set-time and clear-time resolve
to the same id regardless of concurrent Claude Code activity. The
bash invocation below passes `--skill` only; Rust supplies the
session_id itself.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-utility-in-progress --skill flow:flow-decompose-project
```

If the marker-write call returns `status: error` with
`no session_id available` (no env var AND no capture file — rare,
only on Claude Code installs without per-subprocess env support and
without a SessionStart capture file), the skill proceeds without
the marker. The Stop hook treats a missing marker as a non-block,
so the skill runs without protection but does not break.

The marker is held across the entire Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 →
Step 4 → Step 5 → Step 6 chain. Step Dispatch (above) skips the
Announce banner on `--step N` self-invocations, so the marker-set
call fires exactly once at the first invocation. The marker is
cleared at Cancel branches in Step 1 and Step 2 and at the Step 6
success path; every other path holds the marker until Step 6
completes.

On Claude Code installs without the per-subprocess env var, the
capture-file fallback resolves session_id independently at set and
clear time. A second Claude Code session whose SessionStart hook
overwrites the capture file between this skill's set and clear
calls can leave the marker orphaned at the original id. Recovery
is `rm ~/.claude/flow/utility-in-progress-*.json` after the skill
completes; the Stop hook treats a missing marker as a non-block.

## Resume Check

Use the Read tool to read `.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>.json`, where
`<id>` is the session identifier from the `--id` flag. If no `--id` flag
was passed (first run), there is no file to read — proceed to Step 1.

Dispatch based on `decompose_step`:

- `0` or absent — proceed to Step 1
- `1` — skip to Step 2
- `2` — skip to Step 3
- `3` — skip to Step 4
- `4` — skip to Step 5
- `5` — skip to Step 6

---

## Step 1 — Describe and Decompose

Output in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
  ── Step 1 of 6: Describe and Decompose ──
```
````

Take the user's project description and invoke the `decompose:decompose`
plugin via the Skill tool. The decomposition must include deep codebase
exploration using Glob, Grep, and Read to ground every finding.

Present the full DAG synthesis to the user.

<HARD-GATE>

Ask the user to review the decomposition using AskUserQuestion:

- **"Proceed to review"** → generate a session ID by running
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow generate-id` via the Bash tool.
  Write `{"decompose_step": 1}` to
  `.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>.json` using the Write tool.
  Save the full decompose output to
  `.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-dag.md` using the Write tool.
  Then invoke `flow:flow-decompose-project --step 2 --id <id>` using
  the Skill tool as your final action.
- **"Iterate"** → re-invoke `decompose:decompose` with feedback, present
  the updated synthesis, and ask again.
- **"Cancel"** → clear the utility-in-progress marker so the Stop
  hook does not refuse turn-end after cancellation, then stop. Do
  not file any issues.

  ```bash
  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow clear-utility-in-progress --skill flow:flow-decompose-project
  ```

Do not proceed to Step 2 without explicit user approval. Do not propose
direct edits, commit changes, or take any action outside this skill.

</HARD-GATE>

---

## Step 2 — Review Issue List

Output in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
  ── Step 2 of 6: Review Issue List ──
```
````

Use the Read tool to read the DAG output from
`.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-dag.md`.

From the DAG synthesis, build a complete issue list:

1. **Parent epic** — a single umbrella issue describing the full project
2. **Child issues** — one per DAG leaf task, in topological order (leaves
   first so dependencies exist when referenced)
3. **Phase labels** — auto-derive from DAG groupings (e.g., "Phase 1: API",
   "Phase 2: SPA"). Each child issue gets a phase label.

For both the parent epic AND each child issue, draft:

- **Title** — concise, actionable
- **Body** — see the Body Shape Contract below. The same contract
  applies to the parent epic and to every child issue — this skill
  is the single source of truth for body shape, and Steps 3 and 4
  just write the bytes that this step produces.
- **Labels** — `decomposed` plus the auto-derived phase label
  (child issues only; the parent epic is filed without these
  labels in Step 3)
- **Dependencies** — which other child issues this depends on
  (by title, resolved to numbers in Step 4); the parent epic has
  no dependencies

### Body Shape Contract

Every issue body — parent epic AND every child — uses this section
order:

1. **Problem** (`## Summary` heading) — what is broken, missing, or
   inadequate. Include observable behavior, evidence from the
   codebase (file paths, line numbers), and user impact. Grounded
   in the exploration the decompose step already performed.
2. **Acceptance Criteria** — binary, testable conditions. Pass/fail
   with no subjective judgment.
3. **Implementation Plan** — wrapped in the FLOW-PLAN sentinel
   pair (see the wrapping rule below) and containing these
   `###` subsections in order:
   - **Context** — what the user wants to build and why
   - **Exploration** — what exists in the codebase, affected
     files, patterns discovered
   - **Risks** — what could go wrong, edge cases, constraints
   - **Approach** — the chosen approach and rationale
   - **Dependency Graph** — table of tasks with types and
     dependencies
   - **Tasks** — ordered implementation tasks using `#### Task N:`
     headers (these become `### Task N:` headings in the
     `.flow-states/<branch>/plan.md` file after `bin/flow
     plan-from-issue` extraction). The `#### Task N:` header
     format — not a numbered list — is the heading shape
     `count_tasks` recognises to populate `code_tasks_total`.
   - **Acceptance Criteria** — binary, testable conditions for
     the implementation
4. **Files to Investigate** — real file paths verified during
   decomposition with a brief note on why each is relevant.
5. **Context** — business reason, architectural constraints, or
   design decisions.

**Wrap the Implementation Plan in the FLOW-PLAN sentinel pair.**
Place the literal HTML comment `<!-- FLOW-PLAN-BEGIN -->` on its
own line immediately before the `## Implementation Plan` heading,
and the literal HTML comment `<!-- FLOW-PLAN-END -->` on its own
line immediately after the last Task entry (before the next `##`
heading). The sentinel pair delimits the bytes that `bin/flow
plan-from-issue` extracts verbatim and writes to
`.flow-states/<branch>/plan.md` when the issue is later picked up
via `/flow:flow-start #N`. Without the sentinel pair,
`plan-from-issue` rejects the issue with `plan_markers_missing`
and the flow halts.

**Paraphrase every prose reference to the plan-sentinel pair.**
The literal HTML-comment marker strings only appear in each body
at two positions — the opening sentinel and the closing sentinel.
They must never appear inside prose, headings, code blocks,
examples, or any other surface of the body. `bin/flow
plan-from-issue` extracts the slice between the FIRST occurrence
of each marker, so a literal marker mid-prose silently redirects
the extraction to the wrong slice — exactly the failure mode
`bin/flow validate-issue-body` exists to detect. Whenever a body
needs to reference the marker pair (for example, when an issue's
topic is the sentinel protocol itself), paraphrase every
reference. Acceptable wording: "the FLOW-PLAN sentinel pair",
"the plan-extraction markers", "the canonical sentinels
delimiting the plan block". The validator's `marker_count_wrong`
branch catches violations downstream; this rule prevents them
upstream so the Revise loop in Step 3 or Step 4 is not entered
unnecessarily.

The wrapped block looks like this in each issue body:

```markdown
<!-- FLOW-PLAN-BEGIN -->
## Implementation Plan

### Context
...

### Exploration
...

### Tasks

#### Task 1: ...
...
<!-- FLOW-PLAN-END -->
```

### Backwards-Reasoning Scan

After composing each child issue body and before presenting the
issue list, scan every child body for the following forbidden
phrasings, which ground the current decomposition in a historical
artifact rather than the code's current merits:

- `"PR #<N> decided"`, `"the prior PR chose"`, `"the previous
  commit"` — historical decision cited as authority
- `"kept for backward compatibility"`, `"compat shim"`, `"legacy
  alias for older"` — preservation justified by inherited
  reasoning rather than a current consumer
- `"older plugin versions"`, `"prior plugin"` — plugin-version-
  compat reasoning (the FLOW plugin auto-updates and has no
  installed base)
- `"as PR #<N> chose to"`, `"following the prior PR"` —
  deferring to past decisions

Evaluate matches in context: a bare `PR #<N>` reference used for
forensic detection (linking blocked-by, naming a specific merge)
is fine; a `PR #<N>` reference used to justify the present design
is forbidden. If any match is justifying-shape rather than
identifier-shape in any child body, revise that body. Re-evaluate
the underlying decision on the code's current merits, not on
historical context. The scan applies to every child issue
produced by this skill, not just the first one.
See `.claude/rules/no-backwards-reasoning.md`.

Present the full issue list as a table:

| # | Title | Phase | Depends On |
|---|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Epic: <project_name> | — | — |
| 2 | <first leaf task> | Phase 1: API | — |
| 3 | <second task> | Phase 1: API | 2 |

Below the table, show each issue's full body text so the user can
review every detail.

<HARD-GATE>

Ask the user for the milestone due date and approval using AskUserQuestion:

> "Review the issue list above. What is the milestone due date (YYYY-MM-DD)?
> Enter a date to proceed, or 'revise' to make changes."

- **Date provided** → record the due date. Write
  `{"decompose_step": 2, "due_date": "<date>"}` to
  `.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>.json` using the Write tool.
  Save the approved issue list to
  `.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-issues.json` using the Write
  tool (array of `{title, body, labels, depends_on_indices}` objects).
  Then invoke `flow:flow-decompose-project --step 3 --id <id>` using
  the Skill tool as your final action.
- **"Revise"** → ask what to change, update the list, and re-present.
  Iterate until approved.
- **"Cancel"** → clear the utility-in-progress marker so the Stop
  hook does not refuse turn-end after cancellation, then stop.

  ```bash
  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow clear-utility-in-progress --skill flow:flow-decompose-project
  ```

Do not proceed to Step 3 without explicit user approval. Do not propose
direct edits, commit changes, or take any action outside this skill.

</HARD-GATE>

## Step 3 — Create Epic and Milestone

Output in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
  ── Step 3 of 6: Create Epic and Milestone ──
```
````

Use the Read tool to read the session state from
`.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>.json` to get the `due_date`.
Use the Read tool to read the approved issue list from
`.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-issues.json`.

Detect the repo:

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

Parse `owner/repo` from the remote URL.

Create the milestone:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow create-milestone --repo <repo> --title "<project_name>" --due-date <due_date>
```

Parse the JSON output. Record the milestone number.

Create the parent epic issue. The `--milestone` flag accepts the milestone
title (not the numeric ID) — use the same `<project_name>` that was passed
to `create-milestone --title`. Write the epic body to
`.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-epic-body` using the Write tool.

Validate the epic body through the pre-filing validator before
asking the filer subcommand to send it to GitHub. The validator
runs the same sentinel-extraction logic that `bin/flow
plan-from-issue` applies at flow-start; any body that fails this
gate is unconsumable downstream and must NOT be filed:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow validate-issue-body --body-file .flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-epic-body
```

Parse the JSON output. If `status` is `ok`, proceed to the filer
invocation below. If `status` is `error`, do NOT file the issue.
Surface the validator's `message` field to the user via
AskUserQuestion with three options:

- **"Revise the epic body and retry"** — ask what to change, edit
  the Write tool output at
  `.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-epic-body`, then re-run
  `bin/flow validate-issue-body` from the top of this step. Loop
  until the validator returns `status:ok`.
- **"Cancel filing this issue"** — skip the epic-filing path. The
  flow halts at Step 3 since the epic is the parent of every
  child issue; clear the utility-in-progress marker so the Stop
  hook releases turn-end:

  ```bash
  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow clear-utility-in-progress --skill flow:flow-decompose-project
  ```

- **"Cancel the whole skill"** — same clear-marker call as above,
  then stop without filing any issues.

Once the validator returns `ok`, file the epic:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow issue --repo <repo> --title "Epic: <project_name>" --body-file .flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-epic-body --milestone "<project_name>"
```

Parse the JSON output. Record the epic issue number and database ID.

Update the session state with milestone and epic info. Write the updated
state to `.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>.json` using the Write tool,
adding `milestone_number`, `epic_number`, and `epic_id` fields.
Set `decompose_step` to `3`.

Then invoke `flow:flow-decompose-project --step 4 --id <id>` using the
Skill tool as your final action.

---

## Step 4 — Create Child Issues

Output in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
  ── Step 4 of 6: Create Child Issues ──
```
````

Use the Read tool to read the session state and approved issue list.

Create each child issue in topological order (leaves first). For each:

Write the issue body to `.flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-issue-body`
using the Write tool, then create the issue:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow issue --repo <repo> --title "<title>" --body-file .flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-issue-body --label decomposed --milestone "<project_name>"
```

Parse the JSON output and record `{title, number, id}` in the mapping.

Record the issue (no-op if no FLOW feature is active):

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow add-issue --label decomposed --title "<title>" --url "<issue_url>" --phase flow-decompose-project
```

After all issues are created, write the complete mapping to the session
state file (`issues` array with `{title, number, id}` objects).
Set `decompose_step` to `4`.

Then invoke `flow:flow-decompose-project --step 5 --id <id>` using the
Skill tool as your final action.

---

## Step 5 — Link Relationships

Output in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
  ── Step 5 of 6: Link Relationships ──
```
````

Use the Read tool to read the session state to get `epic_number` and
the `issues` mapping.

### Sub-issue relationships (children to epic)

For each child issue, link it as a sub-issue of the epic:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow create-sub-issue --repo <repo> --parent-number <epic_number> --child-number <child_number>
```

Best-effort — log failures but continue.

### Blocked-by relationships (between children)

For each child issue that has dependencies, create the blocked-by link:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow link-blocked-by --repo <repo> --blocked-number <child_number> --blocking-number <dep_number>
```

Best-effort — log failures but continue.

Set `decompose_step` to `5` in the session state.

Then invoke `flow:flow-decompose-project --step 6 --id <id>` using the
Skill tool as your final action.

---

## Step 6 — Report

Output in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
  ── Step 6 of 6: Report ──
```
````

Use the Read tool to read the session state.

Present a summary table:

| # | Title | Issue | Phase | Dependencies |
|---|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| — | Epic: <name> | #N | — | — |
| 1 | <task> | #N | Phase 1 | — |
| 2 | <task> | #N | Phase 1 | #N |

Include:

- Total issues created
- Milestone link
- Sub-issue relationships created (count)
- Blocked-by dependencies created (count)
- Any failures encountered

Clean up the session files:

```bash
rm .flow-states/decompose-project-<id>.json .flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-dag.md .flow-states/decompose-project-<id>-issues.json
```

Clear the utility-in-progress marker so the Stop hook stops refusing
turn-end now that the skill has completed its work:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow clear-utility-in-progress --skill flow:flow-decompose-project
```

Output the COMPLETE banner:

````markdown
```text
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✓ FLOW v1.1.0 — flow:flow-decompose-project — COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
````

## Hard Rules

- Never file issues without explicit user approval — Steps 1 and 2 are mandatory gates
- Never skip codebase exploration in the decompose step
- Never tell the user to "look at" a file — render all content inline
- Never use Bash to print banners — output them as text in your response
- Always use the Write tool to create body files — never pass body text as a CLI argument
- Never delete body files — the `bin/flow issue` script handles cleanup
- Each step ends by invoking the skill itself as the final action — never continue to the next step in the same invocation
- All `bin/flow` calls use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow`
- Session state files use the `<id>` prefix to prevent concurrent collisions
- Issue creation order is topological — leaves first so dependency numbers exist
- Phase labels are auto-derived from DAG groupings, not user-specified
- Milestone due date is required — asked during Step 2 review
- Sub-issue and blocked-by linking is best-effort — failures do not block the skill
