# FLOW Init — One-Time Project Setup

## Usage

```text
/flow:flow-init
```

Run once after installing FLOW, and again after each FLOW upgrade. Configures workspace permissions, git excludes, and writes a version marker so `/flow:flow-start` knows the project is initialized.

## Announce

At the very start, output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
============================================
  FLOW v0.19.1 — Init — STARTING
============================================
```
````

## Steps

### Step 1 — Detect framework

Auto-detect the framework using the data-driven detector:

```bash
exec ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow detect-framework <project_root>
```

Parse the JSON output. The `detected` array contains frameworks matched
by file presence, and `available` lists all supported frameworks.

If exactly one framework is detected, confirm with AskUserQuestion:

> "Detected **<display_name>** project. Is this correct?"
>
> - **Yes, <display_name>** — "Proceed with <display_name> setup"
> - One option per other available framework — "<display_name>"

If no frameworks detected, or multiple detected, ask the user to choose
from the available list using AskUserQuestion with one option per
available framework.

Store the answer as `framework` (lowercase name from the JSON).

### Step 2 — Choose autonomy level

FLOW has two independent axes for skills that support them:

- **Commit** — how `/flow:flow-commit` is invoked during phase work (auto = skip diff approval, manual = require approval). Also controls per-task approval in Code and refactoring approval in Simplify.
- **Continue** — whether to auto-advance to the next phase or prompt first.

Phase skills that commit (code, simplify, review, security, learning) have both axes. Phase skills that don't commit (start) only have continue. Utility skills (abort, cleanup) have a single mode value. The `/flow:flow-commit` skill is not configurable — it defaults to auto and can be overridden with `--manual`.

Ask the user how much autonomy FLOW should have using AskUserQuestion:

> "How much autonomy should FLOW have?"
>
> - **Fully autonomous** — "All skills auto for both commit and continue"
> - **Fully manual** — "All skills manual for both commit and continue"
> - **Recommended** — "Auto where safe, manual where judgment matters (default)"
> - **Customize** — "Choose per skill and axis"

**Fully autonomous** — all auto:

```json
{"flow-start": {"continue": "auto"}, "flow-code": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-simplify": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-review": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-security": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-learning": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-abort": "auto", "flow-cleanup": "auto"}
```

**Fully manual** — all manual:

```json
{"flow-start": {"continue": "manual"}, "flow-code": {"commit": "manual", "continue": "manual"}, "flow-simplify": {"commit": "manual", "continue": "manual"}, "flow-review": {"commit": "manual", "continue": "manual"}, "flow-security": {"commit": "manual", "continue": "manual"}, "flow-learning": {"commit": "manual", "continue": "manual"}, "flow-abort": "manual", "flow-cleanup": "manual"}
```

**Recommended** — safe defaults for all frameworks:

```json
{"flow-start": {"continue": "manual"}, "flow-code": {"commit": "manual", "continue": "manual"}, "flow-simplify": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-review": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-security": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-learning": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-abort": "auto", "flow-cleanup": "auto"}
```

**Customize** — ask per skill, in this order: start, code, simplify, review, security, learning, abort, cleanup. For each skill, ask about only the applicable axes:

For skills with both axes (code, simplify, review, security, learning), ask two AskUserQuestions:

First question:

> "Commit mode for /flow:flow-<skill>? (controls diff approval and per-task approval)"
>
> - **Auto** — "Skip approval prompts"
> - **Manual** — "Require explicit approval"

Second question:

> "Continue mode for /flow:flow-<skill>? (controls phase advancement)"
>
> - **Auto** — "Auto-advance to next phase"
> - **Manual** — "Prompt before advancing"

For skills with continue only (start), ask one AskUserQuestion:

> "Continue mode for /flow:flow-<skill>?"
>
> - **Auto** — "Auto-advance to next phase"
> - **Manual** — "Prompt before advancing"

For utility skills (abort, cleanup), ask one AskUserQuestion:

> "Mode for /flow:flow-<skill>?"
>
> - **Auto** — "Skip confirmation prompt"
> - **Manual** — "Require confirmation prompt"

Store the result as `skills_dict` for Step 3.

### Step 3 — Run init setup script

```bash
exec ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow init-setup <project_root> --framework <framework>
```

The script handles:

- Reading or creating `.claude/settings.json`
- Merging FLOW permissions (additive only — preserves existing entries)
- Setting `defaultMode` to `acceptEdits` (overrides existing values — FLOW requires this for state file writes without prompts)
- Writing `.flow.json` with version marker and framework
- Adding `.flow-states/` and `.worktrees/` to `.git/info/exclude`

Output JSON: `{"status": "ok", "settings_merged": true, "exclude_updated": true, "version_marker": true, "framework": "rails|python"}`

If the script returns an error, show the message and stop.

The permissions merged depend on the framework. Universal permissions are
always merged. Framework-specific permissions are loaded from
`frameworks/<name>/permissions.json` and added based on the chosen framework.

All permissions (universal + all framework sets) for reference:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git -C *)",
      "Bash(git add *)",
      "Bash(git commit *)",
      "Bash(git push)",
      "Bash(git push -u *)",
      "Bash(git reset HEAD)",
      "Bash(git worktree *)",
      "Bash(git pull origin *)",
      "Bash(gh pr create *)",
      "Bash(gh pr edit *)",
      "Bash(gh pr close *)",
      "Bash(git push origin --delete *)",
      "Bash(git branch -D *)",
      "Bash(bin/ci)",
      "Bash(bin/dependencies)",
      "Bash(rm .flow-commit-*)",
      "Bash(rm .claude/settings.local.json)",
      "Bash(*bin/flow *)",
      "Bash(gh pr view *)",
      "Bash(gh issue create *)",
      "Bash(bin/rails test *)",
      "Bash(rubocop *)",
      "Bash(rubocop -A)",
      "Bash(bundle update --all)",
      "Bash(bundle exec *)",
      "Bash(psql *)",
      "Bash(bin/test *)",
      "Bash(.venv/bin/pip install *)",
      "Bash(git restore *)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(git rebase *)",
      "Bash(git push --force *)",
      "Bash(git push -f *)",
      "Bash(git reset --hard *)",
      "Bash(git stash *)",
      "Bash(git checkout *)",
      "Bash(git clean *)",
      "Bash(* && *)",
      "Bash(* ; *)"
    ]
  },
  "defaultMode": "acceptEdits"
}
```

### Step 4 — Write skills config to .flow.json

After the init-setup script writes `.flow.json`, read it back with the Read tool,
add the `skills` key from `skills_dict` (Step 2), and write the file back with
the Write tool. The result should look like:

```json
{"flow_version": "0.16.4", "framework": "python", "skills": {"flow-start": {"continue": "manual"}, "flow-code": {"commit": "manual", "continue": "manual"}, "flow-simplify": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-review": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-security": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-learning": {"commit": "auto", "continue": "auto"}, "flow-abort": "auto", "flow-cleanup": "auto"}}
```

### Step 5 — Prime project CLAUDE.md

If the project has a `CLAUDE.md`, prime it with framework conventions:

```bash
exec ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow prime-project <project_root> --framework <framework>
```

Parse the JSON output. If `"status": "ok"`, the project CLAUDE.md now
contains framework conventions between `<!-- FLOW:BEGIN -->` and
`<!-- FLOW:END -->` markers. If `"status": "error"`, skip priming
silently — the user can prime later by running init again after
creating a CLAUDE.md.

### Step 6 — Create bin/dependencies

Create the dependency updater script from the framework template:

```bash
exec ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow create-dependencies <project_root> --framework <framework>
```

Parse the JSON output. If `"status": "ok"`, `bin/dependencies` was
created. If `"status": "skipped"`, the file already exists (user may
have customized it). If `"status": "error"`, report to the user.

### Step 7 — Commit and push

Stage the settings and version marker:

```bash
git add .claude/settings.json .flow.json
```

Check if anything is staged by running `git status`. If the output contains "nothing to commit", skip the commit and push — go straight to Done.

Otherwise, commit and push:

```bash
git commit -m "Configure FLOW workspace permissions and version marker"
```

```bash
git push
```

### Done — Complete

Output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
============================================
  FLOW v0.19.1 — Init — COMPLETE
============================================
```
````

Report:

- Framework: `<framework>`
- Settings written to `.claude/settings.json`
- Version marker written to `.flow.json`
- Git excludes configured for `.flow-states/` and `.worktrees/`
- Changes committed

Display the skills configuration as a pipe-delimited markdown table with exactly this format (not a bullet list):

```text
| Skill     | Commit | Continue |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| start     | —      | manual   |
| code      | manual | manual   |
| simplify  | auto   | auto     |
| review    | auto   | auto     |
| security  | auto   | auto     |
| learning  | auto   | auto     |
| abort     | auto   | —        |
| cleanup   | auto   | —        |
```

Use the actual values from `skills_dict` (Step 2). The table above is just an example. Show `—` for axes that don't apply to a skill. The table must use pipe `|` delimiters — never render as a bullet list.

Tell the user to start a new Claude Code session so the permissions take effect, then run `/flow-start <feature name>`.
