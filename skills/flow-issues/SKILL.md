# FLOW Issues

Fetch all open issues for the current repository, analyze them via Python
script (file paths, labels, stale detection), then rank by impact using
judgment and display a dashboard. Read-only — never create, edit, or
close issues.

## Usage

```text
/flow:flow-issues
/flow:flow-issues --ready
/flow:flow-issues --blocked
/flow:flow-issues --decomposed
/flow:flow-issues --quick-start
/flow:flow-issues --label Bug
/flow:flow-issues --label Bug --label "Tech Debt"
/flow:flow-issues --milestone v1.2
/flow:flow-issues --label Bug --ready
```

## Readiness Filters

Optional flags filter the issue list by readiness. Flags are mutually
exclusive — pass at most one.

- `--ready` — issues that are not blocked (can start immediately)
- `--blocked` — issues that are blocked (waiting on other work)
- `--decomposed` — issues with the "Decomposed" label (work-ready with prior analysis)
- `--quick-start` — decomposed issues that are not blocked (best candidates for autonomous execution)

No flag returns all issues (current default behavior).

## Narrowing Filters

Optional flags that narrow the issue set before analysis. These are
server-side filters passed directly to `gh issue list` — they reduce
the number of issues fetched, not just displayed.

- `--label <name>` — filter by GitHub label (repeatable; multiple labels
  use AND logic). Can combine with any readiness filter.
- `--milestone <title>` — filter by GitHub milestone (by title or number;
  single value only). Can combine with any readiness filter.

Narrowing filters compose with readiness filters. For example,
`--label Bug --ready` fetches only issues labeled "Bug" from GitHub,
then shows only the non-blocked ones.

## Concurrency

This flow is one of potentially many running simultaneously — on this
machine (multiple worktrees) and across machines (multiple engineers).
Your state file (`.flow-states/<branch>/state.json`) is yours alone. Never
read or write another branch's state. All local artifacts (logs, plan
files, temp files) are scoped by branch name. GitHub state (PRs, issues,
labels) is shared across all engineers — operations that create or modify
shared state must be idempotent.

## Announce

At the very start, output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  FLOW v2.0.0 — flow:flow-issues — STARTING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
```
````

## Step 1 — Fetch and Analyze

Run the analysis script, which calls `gh issue list` internally, parses the
JSON, extracts file paths, detects "Flow In-Progress", "Decomposed", and
"Blocked" labels, checks for stale issues (older than 60 days with missing
file references), and outputs condensed per-issue briefs:

If a readiness filter flag was passed to this skill, append it to the command:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow analyze-issues
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow analyze-issues --ready
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow analyze-issues --blocked
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow analyze-issues --decomposed
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow analyze-issues --quick-start
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow analyze-issues --label Bug
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow analyze-issues --label Bug --label "Tech Debt"
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow analyze-issues --milestone v1.2
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow analyze-issues --label Bug --ready
```

Use the first form when no filter flag was passed. Use the matching form
when a flag was passed. Narrowing filters (`--label`, `--milestone`) can
be combined with each other and with any readiness filter.

Parse the JSON output. The structure is:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "total": 12,
  "in_progress": [{"number": 1, "title": "...", "url": "..."}],
  "issues": [
    {
      "number": 2,
      "title": "...",
      "url": "...",
      "labels": ["Decomposed"],
      "category": "Enhancement",
      "age_days": 5,
      "decomposed": true,
      "blocked": false,
      "native_blocked": false,
      "blocked_by": [],
      "stale": false,
      "stale_missing": 0,
      "file_paths": ["lib/foo.py"],
      "brief": "First ~200 chars of body...",
      "milestone": "v1.2.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

If `status` is `"error"`, show the error message and stop.
If `total` is 0, print the COMPLETE banner and stop.

The `in_progress` array contains issues with the "Flow In-Progress" label —
these are being worked on by another engineer. The `issues` array contains
all other issues available for work.

## Step 2 — Rank by Impact

Read the condensed briefs from Step 1. For each issue, assess its impact
using your judgment — not a formula. Consider:

- **What would unblock the most work?** Issues that are prerequisites for
  others have high impact.
- **What has the broadest effect?** Issues touching many files or areas of
  the codebase have wider impact than narrowly scoped changes.
- **What is urgent?** Bugs and issues blocking active work take priority
  over enhancements.
- **Is it ready for autonomous execution?** Decomposed issues are work-ready
  and can be started immediately without a planning phase.

Sort by highest impact. Ready issues appear before blocked issues.

## Step 3 — Display

Print a summary line with the total issue count.

### In Progress Table

If the `in_progress` array is non-empty, print an "In Progress" table.
Columns: `#`, `Title`. The `#` column shows a markdown link: `[#N](url)`.

If no issues are in progress, skip this section.

### Recommended Work Order

Print a "Recommended Work Order" section as a single markdown table.
Columns: `Order`, `Status`, `Impact`, `Labels`, `#`, `Title`, `Rationale`.

The `Status` column shows readiness: `Ready` or `Blocked`. Status is
determined by the `blocked` field — `false` = `Ready`, `true` = `Blocked`.

The `Impact` column shows your assessment: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`.

The `#` column shows a markdown link: `[#N](url)`.

The `Labels` column shows the issue's labels as a comma-separated list.

For stale issues, append `[Stale: N files missing]` to the title where N
is the `stale_missing` count.

The `Rationale` column explains why this issue is at this position:

- If `blocked_by` is non-empty: "Blocked by #N, #M" listing the specific blocker issue numbers
- If blocked by label only (no `blocked_by` entries): "Blocked"
- If decomposed: "decomposed — ready for autonomous execution"
- Otherwise: brief reason based on your impact assessment

**Ordering:** All ready issues appear first, sorted by impact. Blocked
issues appear after all ready issues, sorted by impact within the blocked
group.

### Start Commands

After the work order table, print a "Start Commands" table with only the
ready issues from the work order. Columns: `#` (matching the issue's
`Order` position in the work order table), `Command`, `Title` (the issue
title). Do not include blocked issues in this table.

| # | Command | Title |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | `/flow:flow-start work on issue #N` | issue title |
| 2 | `/flow:flow-start work on issue #M` | issue title |

After the start commands are displayed, output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✓ FLOW v2.0.0 — flow:flow-issues — COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
````

## Hard Rules

- Read-only — never create, edit, or close issues
- Display all open issues — in-progress issues appear in the In Progress table, all others in the work order table
- Exclude in-progress issues from the Recommended Work Order
- No AskUserQuestion — this is a display-only skill
- Never use Bash to print banners — output them as text in your response
