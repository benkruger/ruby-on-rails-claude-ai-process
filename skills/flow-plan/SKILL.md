# FLOW Plan — Phase 2: Plan

## Usage

```text
/flow:flow-plan
/flow:flow-plan --auto
/flow:flow-plan --manual
```

- `/flow:flow-plan` — uses configured mode from the state file (default: manual)
- `/flow:flow-plan --auto` — auto-advance to Code without asking
- `/flow:flow-plan --manual` — requires explicit approval before advancing

<HARD-GATE>
Run this phase entry check as your very first action. If any check fails,
stop immediately and show the error to the user.

1. Run both commands in parallel (two Bash calls in one response):
   - `git worktree list --porcelain` — note the path on the first `worktree` line (this is the project root).
   - `git branch --show-current` — this is the current branch.
2. Use the Read tool to read `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>.json`.
   - If the file does not exist: STOP. "BLOCKED: No FLOW feature in progress.
     Run /flow:flow-start first."
3. Check `phases.flow-start.status` in the JSON.
   - If not `"complete"`: STOP. "BLOCKED: Phase 1: Start must be
     complete. Run /flow:flow-start first."
4. Note `pr_number` and `prompt` from the state file — you will need them in Steps 1 and 3.
</HARD-GATE>

Keep the project root, branch, state data, and `pr_number` from the gate
in context — use the project root to build Read tool paths (e.g.
`<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>.json`). Do not re-read the state
file or re-run git commands to gather the same information. Do not `cd`
to the project root — `bin/flow` commands find paths internally.

## Mode Resolution

1. If `--auto` was passed → continue=auto
2. If `--manual` was passed → continue=manual
3. Otherwise, read the state file at `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>.json`. Use `skills.flow-plan.continue`.
4. If the state file has no `skills` key → use built-in default: continue=manual

## Announce

At the very start, output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
============================================
  FLOW v0.28.16 — Phase 2: Plan — STARTING
============================================
```
````

## Update State

Update state for phase entry:

```bash
bin/flow phase-transition --phase flow-plan --action enter
```

Parse the JSON output to confirm `"status": "ok"`.
If `"status": "error"`, report the error and stop.

## Enter Plan Mode

Call `EnterPlanMode` now. All subsequent steps run in plan mode —
no file edits are possible until the plan is approved and ExitPlanMode
is called.

## Logging

No logging for this phase. Plan uses Claude Code's native plan mode —
there are no Bash commands to log beyond the entry gate.

---

## Resuming

If `plan_file` in the state file is already set (not null), the plan was
previously written and approved. Output in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
============================================
  FLOW — Plan already approved
============================================
  Plan file: <plan_file path>
============================================
```
````

Skip to "Done — Update state and complete phase" to finish the phase.

---

## Step 1 — Feature description and issue context

Use the `prompt` from the state file as the feature description. This is the
full text the user passed to `/flow:flow-start` — it describes what to build.

Do not ask "What are we building?" — the prompt is the input for the planning
phase.

### Fetch referenced issues

Check the prompt for `#N` patterns (e.g., `#107`, `#42`). For each unique
issue number found, fetch the issue body:

```bash
gh issue view <issue_number> --json number,title,body
```

Use the issue body as primary planning context — it contains the detailed
problem description, acceptance criteria, and context that the short prompt
cannot convey. The prompt words alone may be ambiguous; the issue body is
the authoritative source.

If the prompt contains no `#N` patterns, skip this step and use the prompt
as-is.

If a fetch fails (issue does not exist, permissions error, network failure),
note the failure and continue with the remaining issues and prompt text.
Do not stop planning because one issue could not be fetched.

Proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — Explore and write the plan

You are already in plan mode (entered after Update State). Explore the
codebase, design the approach, and write the implementation plan to a
plan file. Use the full power of plan mode: read files, search code,
explore patterns, and design the solution.

### Framework Conventions

Read the project's CLAUDE.md for framework-specific conventions (architecture
patterns, test conventions, CI fix order). The CLAUDE.md is primed with
framework knowledge during `/flow:flow-prime`. Follow those conventions when
writing the Tasks section of the plan.

Always include TDD order — test task before every implementation task.

### Plan file structure

The plan file should include these sections:

- **Context** — what the user wants to build and why
- **Exploration** — what exists in the codebase, affected files, patterns discovered
- **Risks** — what could go wrong, edge cases, constraints
- **Approach** — the chosen approach and rationale
- **Tasks** — ordered implementation tasks, each with:
  - Description of what to build
  - Files to create or modify
  - TDD notes (what the test should verify)

---

## Step 3 — Store plan file, complete phase, and exit plan mode

Store the plan file path in the state file BEFORE exiting plan mode.
`ExitPlanMode` may clear context, so nothing after it is guaranteed
to run.

```bash
bin/flow set-timestamp --set plan_file=<plan_file_path>
```

Replace `<plan_file_path>` with the actual path to the plan file that
was written during plan mode.

Add the plan file artifact to the PR:

```bash
bin/flow update-pr-body --pr <pr_number> --add-artifact --label "Plan file" --value <plan_file_path>
```

Complete the phase before exiting plan mode:

```bash
bin/flow phase-transition --phase flow-plan --action complete
```

Parse the JSON output. If `"status": "error"`, report the error and stop.
Save the `formatted_time` field — use it in the Done banner if context
survives. Do not print the timing calculation.

After phase completion is recorded, call `ExitPlanMode`.

---

## Done — Banner and transition (best-effort)

`ExitPlanMode` may clear context. If you reach this section, the phase
is already complete (recorded in Step 3).

Output in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
============================================
  FLOW v0.28.16 — Phase 2: Plan — COMPLETE (<formatted_time>)
============================================
```
````

Invoke `flow:flow-status`.

**If continue=auto**, skip the transition question and invoke `flow:flow-code` directly.

**If continue=manual**, use AskUserQuestion:

> "Phase 2: Plan is complete. Ready to begin Phase 3: Code?"
>
> - **Yes, start Phase 3 now** — invoke `flow:flow-code`
> - **Not yet** — print paused banner
> - **I have a correction or learning to capture**

**If "I have a correction or learning to capture":**
1. Ask the user what they want to capture
2. Invoke `/flow:flow-note` with their message
3. Re-ask with only "Yes, start Phase 3 now" and "Not yet"

**If Yes** — invoke `flow:flow-code` using the Skill tool.

**If Not yet**, output in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
============================================
  FLOW — Paused
  Run /flow:flow-continue when ready to continue.
============================================
```
````

## Hard Rules

- Never write implementation code during Plan — task descriptions only
- The plan file lives in `~/.claude/plans/` — Claude Code's native location
- Store the plan file path in state before completing the phase
- Never use Bash to print banners — output them as text in your response
- Never use AskUserQuestion in Step 1 — print the question as text
- Never use Bash for file reads — use Glob, Read, and Grep tools instead of ls, cat, head, tail, find, or grep
- Never use `cd <path> && git` — use `git -C <path>` for git commands in other directories
- Never cd before running `bin/flow` — it detects the project root internally
