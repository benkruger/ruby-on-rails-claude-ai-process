# FLOW Plan — Phase 4: Plan

<HARD-GATE>
Run this phase entry check as your very first action. If any check fails,
stop immediately and show the error to the user.

1. Find the project root: run `git worktree list --porcelain` and note the
   path on the first `worktree` line.
2. Get the current branch: run `git branch --show-current`.
3. Use the Read tool to read `<project_root>/.claude/flow-states/<branch>.json`.
   - If the file does not exist: STOP. "BLOCKED: No FLOW feature in progress.
     Run /flow:start first."
4. Check `phases.3.status` in the JSON.
   - If not `"complete"`: STOP. "BLOCKED: Phase 3: Design must be
     complete. Run /flow:design first."
</HARD-GATE>

## Announce

At the very start, print inside a fenced code block (triple backticks) so it renders as plain monospace text and not as a markdown heading:

````
```
============================================
  FLOW — Phase 4: Plan — STARTING
  Recommended model: Sonnet
============================================
```
````

## Update State

Read `.claude/flow-states/<branch>.json`. cd into the worktree.

Update Phase 4:
- `status` → `in_progress`
- `started_at` → current UTC timestamp (only if null — never overwrite)
- `session_started_at` → current UTC timestamp
- `visit_count` → increment by 1
- `current_phase` → `4`

Initialise `state["plan"]` if it does not exist:

```json
"plan": {
  "sections": {
    "schema":      { "status": "pending", "tasks": [] },
    "models":      { "status": "pending", "tasks": [] },
    "workers":     { "status": "pending", "tasks": [] },
    "controllers": { "status": "pending", "tasks": [] },
    "integration": { "status": "pending", "tasks": [] }
  },
  "current_section": null,
  "tasks": [],
  "approved_at": null
}
```

## Logging

After every Bash command completes, log it to `.claude/flow-states/<branch>.log`.

Run the command with exit code capture:

```bash
COMMAND; EC=$?; exit $EC
```

Then Read `.claude/flow-states/<branch>.log` (empty string if it does not
exist yet) and Write it back with this line appended:

```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ [Phase 4] Step X — desc (exit EC)
```

Do NOT use Bash `>>` to write to `.claude/` paths — it triggers Claude
Code's built-in directory protection that settings.json cannot suppress.

Get `<branch>` from the state file.

---

## Resuming Mid-Plan

If `state["plan"]["current_section"]` is already set, this is a resume.

Show what is already approved. Print inside a fenced code block (triple backticks) so it renders as plain monospace text and not as a markdown heading:

````
```
============================================
  FLOW — Plan in progress
============================================

  Approved sections:
  [x] Schema
  [x] Models

  Resuming at: Workers

============================================
```
````

Then use AskUserQuestion:

> "Ready to continue from the Workers section?"
> - **Yes, continue** — jump to that section
> - **Go back to an approved section** — show picker of approved sections

---

## Step 1 — Quick check-in

Use AskUserQuestion:

> "Ready to plan? Anything to add before we start?"
> - **Ready — generate tasks from the design**
> - **I want to add something first** — describe it in Other

If the user adds something, note it and incorporate it into the plan.

---

## Step 2 — Read the design

Read `state["design"]` from the state file:
- `feature_description`
- `schema_changes`
- `model_changes`
- `controller_changes`
- `worker_changes`
- `route_changes`
- `risks`

Skip sections with no changes (e.g., if `worker_changes` is empty,
skip the workers section and note it was skipped).

---

## Section Structure

Work through each section below in order. For each section:

1. Generate tasks for that section
2. Verify tasks via mandatory sub-agent
3. Adjust tasks based on sub-agent findings
4. Present them clearly
5. Ask the section approval question
6. Handle the response

### Section Verification via Sub-Agent

After generating tasks for a section, launch a mandatory sub-agent to verify
them. Use the Task tool:

- `subagent_type`: `"Explore"`
- `description`: `"Plan task verification — <section name>"`

Provide these instructions to the sub-agent (fill in the details):

> You are verifying plan tasks for the FLOW plan phase.
> Feature: <feature name from state>
> Section: <current section name>
>
> Design decisions: <paste relevant state["design"] fields>
> Research findings: <paste relevant state["research"] fields>
>
> Tasks to verify:
> <paste the draft tasks for this section>
>
> **Tool rules:** Use Glob and Read tools for all file and directory checks.
> Never use Bash for file existence checks (`test -f`, `ls`, `stat`, etc.).
>
> For each task, check the codebase:
>
> 1. **File paths** — Use Glob to verify files exist. For new files,
>    use Glob on the parent directory to confirm it exists.
> 2. **Test helpers** — Use Grep to search test/support/ for create_*!
>    helpers. If not found, flag that a helper creation task is needed.
> 3. **Route context** — Use Read to check route files. What routes already
>    exist in the target file? What patterns are used?
> 4. **Schema context** — Use Read to check data/release.sql for related tables.
>
> Return per-task:
> - File paths: verified / corrected
> - Available helpers (if test task)
> - Route context (if route/controller task)
> - Schema context (if schema task)
> - Any corrections needed

Adjust tasks based on the sub-agent's findings before presenting the
section to the user.

### Section Approval Question

At the end of every section, use AskUserQuestion:

> "Does the [Section Name] plan look right?"
> - **Yes, looks good** — mark section approved, move to next
> - **Needs changes** — describe in Other, revise and re-present
> - **Go back to [previous section]** — only shown if one section back
> - **Go back further** — only shown if two or more sections back

**"Go back further"** triggers a second AskUserQuestion listing all
approved sections as options. User picks one. Mark that section and
all sections after it as `pending`, re-open the chosen section.

When going back: explain clearly which sections were invalidated and
why (because earlier decisions affect later ones).

---

## Section 1 — Schema

*Skip if `design["schema_changes"]` is empty.*

Generate tasks for all `data/release.sql` changes:

```
Task 1 — Schema
  Add <table_name> table to data/release.sql
  Files: data/release.sql
  Note: Column types, constraints, indexes, foreign keys
```

One task per table or significant column change. Be specific — include
column names, types, and any constraints.

**No back navigation on first section.**

---

## Section 2 — Models and Tests

Generate tasks following strict TDD order — test before implementation:

```
Task N — Test (failing)
  Write failing test for <Model>::Base — <what it tests>
  Files: test/models/<model>/base_test.rb
  Helper: test/support/<model>_helpers.rb (create_<model>! if needed)
  TDD: write test first, run it, confirm it fails

Task N+1 — Implementation
  Implement <Model>::Base
  Files: app/models/<model>/base.rb
  Note: table_name, soft delete, associations, callbacks

Task N+2 — Test (failing)
  Write failing test for <Model>::Create
  Files: test/models/<model>/create_test.rb

Task N+3 — Implementation
  Implement <Model>::Create
  Files: app/models/<model>/create.rb
```

Pair every implementation task with a test task that comes before it.
Check `test/support/` — if a `create_*!` helper is missing, add a task
to create it before the test task that needs it.

---

## Section 3 — Workers

*Skip if `design["worker_changes"]` is empty.*

Generate tasks following TDD order:

```
Task N — Test (failing)
  Write failing test for <Worker>
  Files: test/workers/<worker>_test.rb
  Note: Test pre_perform!, perform!, post_perform! separately
        Test halt! conditions

Task N+1 — Implementation
  Implement <Worker>
  Files: app/workers/<worker>.rb
  Note: Queue from config/sidekiq.yml, pre_perform!/perform!/post_perform! structure
```

---

## Section 4 — Controllers and Routes

Generate tasks following TDD order:

```
Task N — Route
  Add route to config/routes/<file>.rb
  Files: config/routes/<file>.rb
  Note: scope with module:, as:, controller:, action: explicitly

Task N+1 — Test (failing)
  Write failing controller test
  Files: test/controllers/<path>_test.rb
  Note: authenticate_admin! or authenticate_user! as needed

Task N+2 — Implementation
  Implement <Controller>#<action>
  Files: app/controllers/<path>_controller.rb
  Note: options OpenStruct params, render_ok/render_error responses
```

---

## Section 5 — Integration Tests

Generate tasks for any cross-cutting test coverage:

```
Task N — Integration test
  Write integration test for <end-to-end flow>
  Files: test/integration/<name>_test.rb
  Note: Full lifecycle — create, read, edge cases
```

---

## Step 3 — Final Full Plan Review

Once all sections are approved, show the complete ordered task list. Print inside a fenced code block (triple backticks) so it renders as plain monospace text and not as a markdown heading:

````
```
============================================
  FLOW — Phase 4: Plan — FULL PLAN
============================================

  Feature: <feature>

  [ ] Task 1  — Schema:  Add payments table to data/release.sql
  [ ] Task 2  — Test:    Failing test for Payment::Base
  [ ] Task 3  — Model:   Implement Payment::Base
  [ ] Task 4  — Test:    Failing test for Payment::Create
  [ ] Task 5  — Model:   Implement Payment::Create
  [ ] Task 6  — Test:    Failing test for PaymentWebhookWorker
  [ ] Task 7  — Worker:  Implement PaymentWebhookWorker
  [ ] Task 8  — Route:   Add POST /api/webhooks/payment
  [ ] Task 9  — Test:    Controller test for webhooks#payment
  [ ] Task 10 — Impl:    Implement WebhooksController#payment
  [ ] Task 11 — Test:    Integration test for full webhook flow
  [ ] Task 12 — CI:      bin/ci green

============================================
```
````

Then use AskUserQuestion:

> "Does the full plan look right?"
> - **Approve — ready to code**
> - **Needs changes** — describe which tasks to revise
> - **Go back to a plan section** — show section picker
> - **Go back to Design** — approach needs rethinking
> - **Go back to Research** — something was missed

**"Go back to Design"** — update Phase 4 to `pending`, Phase 3 to
`in_progress`, then invoke `flow:design`.

**"Go back to Research"** — update Phase 4 to `pending`, Phase 3 to
`pending`, Phase 2 to `in_progress`, then invoke `flow:research`.

---

## Step 4 — Save plan to state

Write to `.claude/flow-states/<branch>.json` under `plan`:

```json
"plan": {
  "sections": {
    "schema":      { "status": "approved", "tasks": [1] },
    "models":      { "status": "approved", "tasks": [2,3,4,5] },
    "workers":     { "status": "approved", "tasks": [6,7] },
    "controllers": { "status": "approved", "tasks": [8,9,10] },
    "integration": { "status": "approved", "tasks": [11,12] }
  },
  "current_section": null,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "section": "schema",
      "type": "schema",
      "description": "Add payments table to data/release.sql",
      "files": ["data/release.sql"],
      "tdd": false,
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ],
  "approved_at": "<current UTC timestamp>"
}
```

---

## Done — Update state and complete phase

Update Phase 4 in state:
1. `cumulative_seconds` += `current_time - session_started_at`
2. `status` → `complete`
3. `completed_at` → current UTC timestamp
4. `session_started_at` → `null`
5. `current_phase` → `5`

Invoke `flow:status`, then use AskUserQuestion:

> "Phase 4: Plan is complete. Ready to begin Phase 5: Code?"
> - **Yes, start Phase 5 now** — invoke `flow:code`
> - **Not yet** — print paused banner
> - **I have a correction or learning to capture**

**If "I have a correction or learning to capture":**
1. Ask the user what they want to capture
2. Invoke `/flow:note` with their message
3. Re-ask with only "Yes, start Phase 5 now" and "Not yet"

**If Yes**, print inside a fenced code block:

````
```
============================================
  FLOW — Phase 4: Plan — COMPLETE
============================================
```
````

**If Not yet**, print inside a fenced code block:

````
```
============================================
  FLOW — Paused
  Run /flow:resume when ready to continue.
============================================
```
````

## Hard Rules

- Always TDD order — test task before every implementation task
- Always check `test/support/` for existing helpers before creating new ones
- Never skip sections silently — always note when a section is skipped and why
- When going back invalidates sections, explain clearly which sections need re-approval
- Never write implementation code during Plan — task descriptions only
