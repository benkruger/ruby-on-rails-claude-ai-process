# FLOW Status

Show where you are in the FLOW workflow. Reads the state file and
prints a status panel. Read-only — never modifies anything.

## Announce

At the very start, print inside a fenced code block (triple backticks) so it renders as plain monospace text and not as a markdown heading:

````markdown
```text
============================================
  FLOW v0.8.2 — flow:status — STARTING
============================================
```
````

## Steps

### Step 1 — Get state file path

Find the project root and current branch:

1. Run `git worktree list --porcelain` and note the path on the first `worktree` line.
2. Run `git branch --show-current`.
3. Build the state file path: `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>.json`.

### Step 2 — Run the status formatter

Read `plugin.json` from the plugin installation directory to get the version.

```bash
python3 hooks/format-status.py <state_file_path> <version>
```

The script outputs JSON:

- `{"status": "no_state"}` — no state file exists. Print inside a fenced code block (triple backticks) so it renders as plain monospace text and not as a markdown heading:

````markdown
```text
No FLOW feature in progress on this branch.
Start one with /flow:start <feature name>.
```
````

Then stop.

- `{"status": "ok", "panel": "..."}` — print the `panel` value inside a fenced code block (triple backticks) so it renders as plain monospace text and not as a markdown heading.

- `{"status": "error", "message": "..."}` — show the error message and stop.

## Rules

- Read-only — never modifies the state file or any other files
- Never calls TaskCreate or TaskUpdate
