//! PreToolUse hook that validates file tool calls in FLOW worktrees.
//!
//! Three enforcement layers:
//! 1. **Worktree path redirection** — blocks file tool calls that target the
//!    main repo when the working directory is inside a FLOW worktree, directing
//!    the caller to use the worktree copy instead.
//! 2. **Out-of-project fail-closed gate** — when the CWD is inside a worktree
//!    (the flow-active proxy), a path outside `project_root` is allowed ONLY
//!    if it falls in the small approved surface
//!    (`is_approved_out_of_project_path`: `/tmp` scratch + auto-memory dir, a
//!    deliberate subset of `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW`'s out-of-project entries). Every
//!    other out-of-project path is blocked (exit 2, no prompt) so an
//!    unattended autonomous flow never hangs on Claude Code's native
//!    permission prompt for an out-of-project path.
//! 3. **Shared config protection** — blocks Edit/Write calls on shared
//!    configuration files (`.gitignore`, `Cargo.toml`, `.github/`, etc.) when
//!    the CWD is inside a `.worktrees/` directory (the flow-active proxy).
//!    Only Edit and Write tool names trigger the block — Read/Glob/Grep are
//!    allowed so codebase exploration is not impacted. The block message
//!    directs the caller to confirm with the user before proceeding.
//!
//! Block surfaces 1 and 2 emit a structured `..._in_autonomous` JSON envelope
//! (`out_of_worktree_in_autonomous` / `out_of_bounds_in_autonomous`) when the
//! active flow is autonomous, and a human-readable `BLOCKED:` prose message
//! otherwise.
//!
//! Fires on Edit, Write, Read, Glob, and Grep tool calls.
//!
//! Exit 0 — allow (path is fine or not in a worktree)
//! Exit 2 — block (path targets main repo, out-of-project, or shared config Edit/Write)

    // this hook use a `BLOCKED:` prose prefix). Default
    // (non-autonomous-flow) behavior unchanged.
